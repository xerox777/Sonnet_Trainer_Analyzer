 o  that you were your self  but  love you are no longer yours  than you your self here live  against this coming end you should prepare  and your sweet semblance to some other give  so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination  then you were yourself again  after yourselfs decease  when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear  who lets so fair a house fall to decay  which husbandry in honour might uphold  against the stormy gusts of winters day and barren rage of deaths eternal cold  o  none but unthrifts  dear my love  you know  you had a father  let your son say so 
 why didst thou promise such a beauteous day  and make me travel forth without my cloak  to let base clouds oertake me in my way  hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke  tis not enough that through the cloud thou break  to dry the rain on my storm beaten face  for no man well of such a salve can speak  that heals the wound  and cures not the disgrace  nor can thy shame give physic to my grief  though thou repent  yet i have still the loss  the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross  ah  but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds  and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds 
 so oft have i invoked thee for my muse  and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse  thine eyes  that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly  have added feathers to the learneds wing and given grace a double majesty  yet be most proud of that which i compile  whose influence is thine  and born of thee  in others works thou dost but mend the style  and arts with thy sweet graces graced be  but thou art all my art  and dost advance as high as learning  my rude ignorance 
 since brass  nor stone  nor earth  nor boundless sea  but sad mortality oersways their power  how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea  whose action is no stronger than a flower  o  how shall summers honey breath hold out  against the wrackful siege of battering days  when rocks impregnable are not so stout  nor gates of steel so strong but time decays  o fearful meditation  where  alack  shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid  or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back  or who his spoil of beauty can forbid  o  none  unless this miracle have might  that in black ink my love may still shine bright 
 is it for fear to wet a widows eye  that thou consumst thy self in single life  ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die  the world will wail thee like a makeless wife  the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind  when every private widow well may keep by childrens eyes  her husbands shape in mind  look  what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it  but beautys waste hath in the world an end  and kept unused the user so destroys it  no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murdrous shame commits 
 o  from what power hast thou this powerful might  with insufficiency my heart to sway  to make me give the lie to my true sight  and swear that brightness doth not grace the day  whence hast thou this becoming of things ill  that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill  that  in my mind  thy worst all best exceeds  who taught thee how to make me love thee more  the more i hear and see just cause of hate  o  though i love what others do abhor  with others thou shouldst not abhor my state  if thy unworthiness raisd love in me  more worthy i to be belovd of thee 
 against that time  if ever that time come  when i shall see thee frown on my defects  when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum  calld to that audit by advisd respects  against that time when thou shalt strangely pass  and scarcely greet me with that sun  thine eye  when love  converted from the thing it was  shall reasons find of settled gravity  against that time do i ensconce me here  within the knowledge of mine own desert  and this my hand  against my self uprear  to guard the lawful reasons on thy part  to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws  since why to love i can allege no cause 
 that thou hast her it is not all my grief  and yet it may be said i loved her dearly  that she hath thee is of my wailing chief  a loss in love that touches me more nearly  loving offenders thus i will excuse ye  thou dost love her  because thou knowst i love her  and for my sake even so doth she abuse me  suffering my friend for my sake to approve her  if i lose thee  my loss is my loves gain  and losing her  my friend hath found that loss  both find each other  and i lose both twain  and both for my sake lay on me this cross  but heres the joy  my friend and i are one  sweet flattery  then she loves but me alone 
 be wise as thou art cruel  do not press my tongue tied patience with too much disdain  lest sorrow lend me words  and words express the manner of my pity wanting pain  if i might teach thee wit  better it were  though not to love  yet  love to tell me so    as testy sick men  when their deaths be near  no news but health from their physicians know    for  if i should despair  i should grow mad  and in my madness might speak ill of thee  now this ill wresting world is grown so bad  mad slanderers by mad ears believed be  that i may not be so  nor thou belied  bear thine eyes straight  though thy proud heart go wide 
 mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld  thy beautys form in table of my heart  my body is the frame wherein tis held  and perspective it is best painters art  for through the painter must you see his skill  to find where your true image picturd lies  which in my bosoms shop is hanging still  that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes  now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done  mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for me are windows to my breast  where through the sun delights to peep  to gaze therein on thee  yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art  they draw but what they see  know not the heart 
 i grant thou wert not married to my muse  and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject  blessing every book  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue  finding thy worth a limit past my praise  and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time bettering days  and do so  love  yet when they have devisd  what strained touches rhetoric can lend  thou truly fair  wert truly sympathizd in true plain words  by thy true telling friend  and their gross painting might be better usd where cheeks need blood  in thee it is abusd 
 o me  what eyes hath love put in my head  which have no correspondence with true sight  or  if they have  where is my judgment fled  that censures falsely what they see aright  if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote  what means the world to say it is not so  if it be not  then love doth well denote loves eye is not so true as all mens  no  how can it  o  how can loves eye be true  that is so vexed with watching and with tears  no marvel then  though i mistake my view  the sun itself sees not  till heaven clears  o cunning love  with tears thou keepst me blind  lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find 
 so  now i have confessd that he is thine  and i my self am mortgagd to thy will  myself ill forfeit  so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still  but thou wilt not  nor he will not be free  for thou art covetous  and he is kind  he learnd but surety like to write for me  under that bond that him as fast doth bind  the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take  thou usurer  that puttst forth all to use  and sue a friend came debtor for my sake  so him i lose through my unkind abuse  him have i lost  thou hast both him and me  he pays the whole  and yet am i not free 
 my love is strengthend  though more weak in seeming  i love not less  though less the show appear  that love is merchandizd  whose rich esteeming  the owners tongue doth publish every where  our love was new  and then but in the spring  when i was wont to greet it with my lays  as philomel in summers front doth sing  and stops her pipe in growth of riper days  not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night  but that wild music burthens every bough  and sweets grown common lose their dear delight  therefore like her  i sometime hold my tongue  because i would not dull you with my song 
 how oft when thou  my music  music playst  upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst the wiry concord that mine ear confounds  do i envy those jacks that nimble leap  to kiss the tender inward of thy hand  whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap  at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand  to be so tickled  they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips  oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait  making dead wood more blessd than living lips  since saucy jacks so happy are in this  give them thy fingers  me thy lips to kiss 
 tired with all these  for restful death i cry  as to behold desert a beggar born  and needy nothing trimmd in jollity  and purest faith unhappily forsworn  and gilded honour shamefully misplacd  and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted  and right perfection wrongfully disgracd  and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority  and folly  doctor like  controlling skill  and simple truth miscalld simplicity  and captive good attending captain ill  tird with all these  from these would i be gone  save that  to die  i leave my love alone 
 accuse me thus  that i have scanted all  wherein i should your great deserts repay  forgot upon your dearest love to call  whereto all bonds do tie me day by day  that i have frequent been with unknown minds  and given to time your own dear purchasd right  that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight  book both my wilfulness and errors down  and on just proof surmise  accumulate  bring me within the level of your frown  but shoot not at me in your wakend hate  since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love 
 that thou art blamd shall not be thy defect  for slanders mark was ever yet the fair  the ornament of beauty is suspect  a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air  so thou be good  slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wood of time  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love  and thou presentst a pure unstained prime  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assaild  or victor being chargd  yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise  to tie up envy  evermore enlargd  if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show  then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 
 weary with toil  i haste me to my bed  the dear respose for limbs with travel tird  but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind  when bodys works expired  for then my thoughts  from far where i abide   intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee  and keep my drooping eyelids open wide  looking on darkness which the blind do see  save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view  which  like a jewel  hung in ghastly night  makes black night beauteous  and her old face new  lo  thus  by day my limbs  by night my mind  for thee  and for myself  no quiet find 
 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold  bare ruind choirs  where late the sweet birds sang  in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west  which by and by black night doth take away  deaths second self  that seals up all in rest  in me thou seest the glowing of such fire  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie  as the death bed  whereon it must expire  consumd with that which it was nourishd by  this thou perceivst  which makes thy love more strong  to love that well  which thou must leave ere long 
 o  how i faint when i of you do write  knowing a better spirit doth use your name  and in the praise thereof spends all his might  to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame  but since your worth  wide as the ocean is    the humble as the proudest sail doth bear  my saucy bark  inferior far to his  on your broad main doth wilfully appear  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride  or  being wrackd  i am a worthless boat  he of tall building  and of goodly pride  then if he thrive and i be cast away  the worst was this   my love was my decay 
 but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant  time  and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme  now stand you on the top of happy hours  and many maiden gardens  yet unset  with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers  much liker than your painted counterfeit  so should the lines of life that life repair  which this  times pencil  or my pupil pen  neither in inward worth nor outward fair  can make you live your self in eyes of men  to give away yourself  keeps yourself still  and you must live  drawn by your own sweet skill 
 lo  as a careful housewife runs to catch one of her featherd creatures broke away  sets down her babe  and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay  whilst her neglected child holds her in chase  cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face  not prizing her poor infants discontent  so runnst thou after that which flies from thee  whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind  but if thou catch thy hope  turn back to me  and play the mothers part  kiss me  be kind  so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will  if thou turn back and my loud crying still 
 no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change  thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel  nothing strange  they are but dressings of a former sight  our dates are brief  and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old  and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told  thy registers and thee i both defy  not wondering at the present nor the past  for thy records and what we see doth lie  made more or less by thy continual haste  this i do vow and this shall ever be  i will be true despite thy scythe and thee 
 if there be nothing new  but that which is hath been before  how are our brains beguild  which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child  o  that record could with a backward look  even of five hundred courses of the sun  show me your image in some antique book  since mind at first in character was done  that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame  whr we are mended  or whr better they  or whether revolution be the same  o  sure i am the wits of former days  to subjects worse have given admiring praise 
 so is it not with me as with that muse  stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse  who heaven itself for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse  making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon  with earth and seas rich gems  with aprils first born flowers  and all things rare  that heavens air in this huge rondure hems  o  let me  true in love  but truly write  and then believe me  my love is as fair as any mothers child  though not so bright as those gold candles fixd in heavens air  let them say more that like of hearsay well  i will not praise that purpose not to sell 
 if thou survive my well contented day  when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover  compare them with the bettring of the time  and though they be outstrippd by every pen  reserve them for my love  not for their rhyme  exceeded by the height of happier men  o  then vouchsafe me but this loving thought  had my friends muse grown with this growing age  a dearer birth than this his love had brought  to march in ranks of better equipage  but since he died and poets better prove  theirs for their style ill read  his for his love 
 my love is as a fever longing still  for that which longer nurseth the disease  feeding on that which doth preserve the ill  the uncertain sickly appetite to please  my reason  the physician to my love  angry that his prescriptions are not kept  hath left me  and i desperate now approve desire is death  which physic did except  past cure i am  now reason is past care  and frantic mad with evermore unrest  my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are  at random from the truth vainly expressd  for i have sworn thee fair  and thought thee bright  who art as black as hell  as dark as night 
 o  never say that i was false of heart  though absence seemd my flame to qualify  as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie  that is my home of love  if i have rangd  like him that travels  i return again  just to the time  not with the time exchangd  so that myself bring water for my stain  never believe though in my nature reignd  all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood  that it could so preposterously be staind  to leave for nothing all thy sum of good  for nothing this wide universe i call  save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all 
 how like a winter hath my absence been from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year  what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen  what old decembers bareness everywhere  and yet this time removed was summers time  the teeming autumn  big with rich increase  bearing the wanton burden of the prime  like widowd wombs after their lords decease  yet this abundant issue seemd to me but hope of orphans  and unfatherd fruit  for summer and his pleasures wait on thee  and  thou away  the very birds are mute  or  if they sing  tis with so dull a cheer  that leaves look pale  dreading the winters near 
 those hours  that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell  will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel  for never resting time leads summer on to hideous winter  and confounds him there  sap checked with frost  and lusty leaves quite gone  beauty oer snowed and bareness every where  then were not summers distillation left  a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass  beautys effect with beauty were bereft  nor it  nor no remembrance what it was  but flowers distilld  though they with winter meet  leese but their show  their substance still lives sweet 
 what potions have i drunk of siren tears  distilld from limbecks foul as hell within  applying fears to hopes  and hopes to fears  still losing when i saw myself to win  what wretched errors hath my heart committed  whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never  how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted  in the distraction of this madding fever  o benefit of ill  now i find true that better is  by evil still made better  and ruind love  when it is built anew  grows fairer than at first  more strong  far greater  so i return rebukd to my content  and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent

 not marble  nor the gilded monuments of princes  shall outlive this powerful rhyme  but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone  besmeard with sluttish time  when wasteful war shall statues overturn  and broils root out the work of masonry  nor mars his sword  nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory  gainst death  and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth  your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom  so  till the judgment that yourself arise  you live in this  and dwell in lovers eyes 
 in the old age black was not counted fair  or if it were  it bore not beautys name  but now is black beautys successive heir  and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame  for since each hand hath put on natures power  fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face  sweet beauty hath no name  no holy bower  but is profand  if not lives in disgrace  therefore my mistress eyes are raven black  her eyes so suited  and they mourners seem at such who  not born fair  no beauty lack  slandring creation with a false esteem  yet so they mourn becoming of their woe  that every tongue says beauty should look so

 the little love god lying once asleep  laid by his side his heart inflaming brand  whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep came tripping by  but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warmd  and so the general of hot desire was  sleeping  by a virgin hand disarmd  this brand she quenched in a cool well by  which from loves fire took heat perpetual  growing a bath and healthful remedy  for men diseasd  but i  my mistress thrall  came there for cure and this by that i prove  loves fire heats water  water cools not love 
 o thou  my lovely boy  who in thy power dost hold times fickle glass  his fickle hour  who hast by waning grown  and therein showst thy lovers withering  as thy sweet self growst  if nature  sovereign mistress over wrack  as thou goest onwards  still will pluck thee back  she keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill  yet fear her  o thou minion of her pleasure  she may detain  but not still keep  her treasure  her audit  though delayed  answered must be  and her quietus is to render thee 
 lo  in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head  each under eye doth homage to his new appearing sight  serving with looks his sacred majesty  and having climbd the steep up heavenly hill  resembling strong youth in his middle age  yet mortal looks adore his beauty still  attending on his golden pilgrimage  but when from highmost pitch  with weary car  like feeble age  he reeleth from the day  the eyes  fore duteous  now converted are from his low tract  and look another way  so thou  thyself outgoing in thy noon  unlookd  on diest unless thou get a son 
 how heavy do i journey on the way  when what i seek  my weary travels end  doth teach that ease and that repose to say  thus far the miles are measured from thy friend  the beast that bears me  tired with my woe  plods dully on  to bear that weight in me  as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lovd not speed  being made from thee  the bloody spur cannot provoke him on  that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide  which heavily he answers with a groan  more sharp to me than spurring to his side  for that same groan doth put this in my mind  my grief lies onward  and my joy behind 
 let me confess that we two must be twain  although our undivided loves are one  so shall those blots that do with me remain  without thy help  by me be borne alone  in our two loves there is but one respect  though in our lives a separable spite  which though it alter not loves sole effect  yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight  i may not evermore acknowledge thee  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame  nor thou with public kindness honour me  unless thou take that honour from thy name  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as thou being mine  mine is thy good report 
 or whether doth my mind  being crownd with you  drink up the monarchs plague  this flattery  or whether shall i say  mine eye saith true  and that your love taught it this alchemy  to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble  creating every bad a perfect best  as fast as objects to his beams assemble  o  tis the first  tis flattery in my seeing  and my great mind most kingly drinks it up  mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing  and to his palate doth prepare the cup  if it be poisond  tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin 
 love is too young to know what conscience is  yet who knows not conscience is born of love  then  gentle cheater  urge not my amiss  lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove  for  thou betraying me  i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason  my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason  but rising at thy name doth point out thee  as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride  he is contented thy poor drudge to be  to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side  no want of conscience hold it that i call her love  for whose dear love i rise and fall

 mine eye and heart are at a mortal war  how to divide the conquest of thy sight  mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar  my heart mine eye the freedom of that right  my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie    a closet never piercd with crystal eyes   but the defendant doth that plea deny  and says in him thy fair appearance lies  to side this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts  all tenants to the heart  and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety  and the dear hearts part  as thus  mine eyes due is thy outward part  and my hearts right  thy inward love of heart 
 my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still  while comments of your praise richly compild  reserve their character with golden quill  and precious phrase by all the muses fild  i think good thoughts  whilst others write good words  and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords  in polishd form of well refined pen  hearing you praised  i say tis so  tis true  and to the most of praise add something more  but that is in my thought  whose love to you  though words come hindmost  holds his rank before  then others  for the breath of words respect  me for my dumb thoughts  speaking in effect 
 music to hear  why hearst thou music sadly  sweets with sweets war not  joy delights in joy  why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly  or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy  if the true concord of well tuned sounds  by unions married  do offend thine ear  they do but sweetly chide thee  who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear  mark how one string  sweet husband to another  strikes each in each by mutual ordering  resembling sire and child and happy mother  who  all in one  one pleasing note do sing  whose speechless song being many  seeming one  sings this to thee  thou single wilt prove none 
 since i left you  mine eye is in my mind  and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind  seems seeing  but effectually is out  for it no form delivers to the heart of bird  of flower  or shape which it doth latch  of his quick objects hath the mind no part  nor his own vision holds what it doth catch  for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight  the most sweet favour or deformedst creature  the mountain or the sea  the day or night  the crow  or dove  it shapes them to your feature  incapable of more  replete with you  my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 
 then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now  now  while the world is bent my deeds to cross  join with the spite of fortune  make me bow  and do not drop in for an after loss  ah  do not  when my heart hath scapd this sorrow  come in the rearward of a conquerd woe  give not a windy night a rainy morrow  to linger out a purposd overthrow  if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last  when other petty griefs have done their spite  but in the onset come  so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might  and other strains of woe  which now seem woe  compard with loss of thee  will not seem so 
 say that thou didst forsake me for some fault  and i will comment upon that offence  speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt  against thy reasons making no defence  thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill  to set a form upon desired change  as ill myself disgrace  knowing thy will  i will acquaintance strangle  and look strange  be absent from thy walks  and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell  lest i  too much profane  should do it wrong  and haply of our old acquaintance tell  for thee  against my self ill vow debate  for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate 
 whilst i alone did call upon thy aid  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace  but now my gracious numbers are decayd  and my sick muse doth give an other place  i grant  sweet love  thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of  and pays it thee again  he lends thee virtue  and he stole that word from thy behaviour  beauty doth he give  and found it in thy cheek  he can afford no praise to thee  but what in thee doth live  then thank him not for that which he doth say  since what he owes thee  thou thyself dost pay

 to me  fair friend  you never can be old  for as you were when first your eye i eyd  such seems your beauty still  three winters cold  have from the forests shook three summers pride  three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd  in process of the seasons have i seen  three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd  since first i saw you fresh  which yet are green  ah  yet doth beauty like a dial hand  steal from his figure  and no pace perceivd  so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand  hath motion  and mine eye may be deceivd  for fear of which  hear this thou age unbred  ere you were born was beautys summer dead 
 thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain full characterd with lasting memory  which shall above that idle rank remain  beyond all date  even to eternity  or  at the least  so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist  till each to razd oblivion yield his part of thee  thy record never can be missd  that poor retention could not so much hold  nor need i tallies thy dear love to score  therefore to give them from me was i bold  to trust those tables that receive thee more  to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me 
 some glory in their birth  some in their skill  some in their wealth  some in their bodys force  some in their garments though new fangled ill  some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse  and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure  wherein it finds a joy above the rest  but these particulars are not my measure  all these i better in one general best  thy love is better than high birth to me  richer than wealth  prouder than garments costs  of more delight than hawks and horses be  and having thee  of all mens pride i boast  wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take all this away  and me most wretchcd make 
 o  how thy worth with manners may i sing  when thou art all the better part of me  what can mine own praise to mine own self bring  and what ist but mine own when i praise thee  even for this  let us divided live  and our dear love lose name of single one  that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservst alone  o absence  what a torment wouldst thou prove  were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave  to entertain the time with thoughts of love  which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive  and that thou teachest how to make one twain  by praising him here who doth hence remain 
 when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment  that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment  when i perceive that men as plants increase  cheered and checked even by the self same sky  vaunt in their youthful sap  at height decrease  and wear their brave state out of memory  then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight  where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night  and all in war with time for love of you  as he takes from you  i engraft you new 
 look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another  whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest  thou dost beguile the world  unbless some mother  for where is she so fair whose uneard womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry  or who is he so fond will be the tomb  of his self love to stop posterity  thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime  so thou through windows of thine age shalt see  despite of wrinkles this thy golden time  but if thou live  rememberd not to be  die single and thine image dies with thee 
 not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come  can yet the lease of my true love control  supposed as forfeit to a confind doom  the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd  and the sad augurs mock their own presage  incertainties now crown themselves assurd  and peace proclaims olives of endless age  now with the drops of this most balmy time  my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes  since  spite of him  ill live in this poor rime  while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes  and thou in this shalt find thy monument  when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 
 no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell  nay  if you read this line  remember not the hand that writ it  for i love you so  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot  if thinking on me then should make you woe  o  if   i say you look upon this verse  when i perhaps compounded am with clay  do not so much as my poor name rehearse  but let your love even with my life decay  lest the wise world should look into your moan  and mock you with me after i am gone 
 let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast  whilst i  whom fortune of such triumph bars unlookd for joy in that i honour most  great princes favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the suns eye  and in themselves their pride lies buried  for at a frown they in their glory die  the painful warrior famoused for fight  after a thousand victories once foild  is from the book of honour razed quite  and all the rest forgot for which he toild  then happy i  that love and am belovd  where i may not remove nor be removd 
 beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me  ist not enough to torture me alone  but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be  me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken  and my next self thou harder hast engrossd  of him  myself  and thee i am forsaken  a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossd  prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward  but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail  whoeer keeps me  let my heart be his guard  thou canst not then use rigour in my jail  and yet thou wilt  for i  being pent in thee  perforce am thine  and all that is in me 
 when most i wink  then do mine eyes best see  for all the day they view things unrespected  but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee  and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed  then thou  whose shadow shadows doth make bright  how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light  when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so  how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day  when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay  all days are nights to see till i see thee  and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 
 when i have seen by times fell hand defacd the rich proud cost of outworn buried age  when sometime lofty towers i see down razd  and brass eternal slave to mortal rage  when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore  and the firm soil win of the watery main  increasing store with loss  and loss with store  when i have seen such interchange of state  or state itself confounded  to decay  ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate   that time will come and take my love away  this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have  that which it fears to lose 
 is it thy will  thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night  dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken  while shadows like to thee do mock my sight  is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry  to find out shames and idle hours in me  the scope and tenure of thy jealousy  o  no  thy love  though much  is not so great  it is my love that keeps mine eye awake  mine own true love that doth my rest defeat  to play the watchman ever for thy sake  for thee watch i  whilst thou dost wake elsewhere  from me far off  with others all too near 
 my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun  coral is far more red  than her lips red  if snow be white  why then her breasts are dun  if hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head  i have seen roses damaskd  red and white  but no such roses see i in her cheeks  and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks  i love to hear her speak  yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound  i grant i never saw a goddess go    my mistress  when she walks  treads on the ground  and yet by heaven  i think my love as rare  as any she belied with false compare 
 thou blind fool  love  what dost thou to mine eyes  that they behold  and see not what they see  they know what beauty is  see where it lies  yet what the best is take the worst to be  if eyes  corrupt by over partial looks  be anchord in the bay where all men ride  why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks  whereto the judgment of my heart is tied  why should my heart think that a several plot  which my heart knows the wide worlds common place  or mine eyes  seeing this  say this is not  to put fair truth upon so foul a face  in things right true my heart and eyes have errd  and to this false plague are they now transferrd 
 those pretty wrongs that liberty commits  when i am sometime absent from thy heart  thy beauty  and thy years full well befits  for still temptation follows where thou art  gentle thou art  and therefore to be won  beauteous thou art  therefore to be assaild  and when a woman woos  what womans son will sourly leave her till he have prevaild  ay me  but yet thou mightst my seat forbear  and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth  who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth    hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee  thine by thy beauty being false to me 
 shall i compare thee to a summers day  thou art more lovely and more temperate  rough winds do shake the darling buds of may  and summers lease hath all too short a date  sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines  and often is his gold complexion dimmd  and every fair from fair sometime declines  by chance  or natures changing course untrimmd  but thy eternal summer shall not fade  nor lose possession of that fair thou owst  nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade  when in eternal lines to time thou growst  so long as men can breathe  or eyes can see  so long lives this  and this gives life to thee 
 my glass shall not persuade me i am old  so long as youth and thou are of one date  but when in thee times furrows i behold  then look i death my days should expiate  for all that beauty that doth cover thee  is but the seemly raiment of my heart  which in thy breast doth live  as thine in me  how can i then be elder than thou art  o  therefore love  be of thyself so wary as i  not for myself  but for thee will  bearing thy heart  which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill  presume not on thy heart when mine is slain  thou gavst me thine not to give back again 
 full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye  kissing with golden face the meadows green  gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy  anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face  and from the forlorn world his visage hide  stealing unseen to west with this disgrace  even so my sun one early morn did shine  with all triumphant splendour on my brow  but out  alack  he was but one hour mine  the region cloud hath maskd him from me now  yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth  suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth 
 in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes  for they in thee a thousand errors note  but tis my heart that loves what they despise  who  in despite of view  is pleased to dote  nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted  nor tender feeling  to base touches prone  nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone  but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee  who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man  thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be  only my plague thus far i count my gain  that she that makes me sin awards me pain 
 thus is his cheek the map of days outworn  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now  before these bastard signs of fair were born  or durst inhabit on a living brow  before the golden tresses of the dead  the right of sepulchres  were shorn away  to live a second life on second head  ere beautys dead fleece made another gay  in him those holy antique hours are seen  without all ornament  itself and true  making no summer of anothers green  robbing no old to dress his beauty new  and him as for a map doth nature store  to show false art what beauty was of yore 
 sin of self love possesseth all mine eye and all my soul  and all my every part  and for this sin there is no remedy  it is so grounded inward in my heart  methinks no face so gracious is as mine  no shape so true  no truth of such account  and for myself mine own worth do define  as i all other in all worths surmount  but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and choppd with tanned antiquity  mine own self love quite contrary i read  self so self loving were iniquity  tis thee   myself   that for myself i praise  painting my age with beauty of thy days 
 if the dull substance of my flesh were thought  injurious distance should not stop my way  for then despite of space i would be brought  from limits far remote  where thou dost stay  no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removd from thee  for nimble thought can jump both sea and land  as soon as think the place where he would be  but  ah  thought kills me that i am not thought  to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone  but that so much of earth and water wrought  i must attend times leisure with my moan  receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears  badges of eithers woe 
 who is it that says most  which can say more  than this rich praise   that you alone  are you  in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew  lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory  but he that writes of you  if he can tell that you are you  so dignifies his story  let him but copy what in you is writ  not making worse what nature made so clear  and such a counterpart shall fame his wit  making his style admired every where  you to your beauteous blessings add a curse  being fond on praise  which makes your praises worse 
 what is your substance  whereof are you made  that millions of strange shadows on you tend  since every one  hath every one  one shade  and you but one  can every shadow lend  describe adonis  and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you  on helens cheek all art of beauty set  and you in grecian tires are painted new  speak of the spring  and foison of the year  the one doth shadow of your beauty show  the other as your bounty doth appear  and you in every blessed shape we know  in all external grace you have some part  but you like none  none you  for constant heart 
 thine eyes i love  and they  as pitying me  knowing thy heart torment me with disdain  have put on black and loving mourners be  looking with pretty ruth upon my pain  and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east  nor that full star that ushers in the even  doth half that glory to the sober west  as those two mourning eyes become thy face  o  let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace  and suit thy pity like in every part  then will i swear beauty herself is black  and all they foul that thy complexion lack 
 as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth  so i  made lame by fortunes dearest spite  take all my comfort of thy worth and truth  for whether beauty  birth  or wealth  or wit  or any of these all  or all  or more  entitled in thy parts  do crowned sit  i make my love engrafted  to this store  so then i am not lame  poor  nor despisd  whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficd  and by a part of all thy glory live  look what is best  that best i wish in thee  this wish i have  then ten times happy me 
 was it the proud full sail of his great verse  bound for the prize of all too precious you  that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse  making their tomb the womb wherein they grew  was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write  above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead  no  neither he  nor his compeers by night giving him aid  my verse astonished  he  nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence  as victors of my silence cannot boast  i was not sick of any fear from thence  but when your countenance filld up his line  then lacked i matter  that enfeebled mine 
 devouring time  blunt thou the lions paws  and make the earth devour her own sweet brood  pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws  and burn the long livd phoenix  in her blood  make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets  and do whateer thou wilt  swift footed time  to the wide world and all her fading sweets  but i forbid thee one most heinous crime  o  carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen  him in thy course untainted do allow for beautys pattern to succeeding men  yet  do thy worst old time  despite thy wrong  my love shall in my verse ever live young 
 alas  tis true  i have gone here and there  and made my self a motley to the view  gord mine own thoughts  sold cheap what is most dear  made old offences of affections new  most true it is  that i have lookd on truth askance and strangely  but  by all above  these blenches gave my heart another youth  and worse essays provd thee my best of love  now all is done  save what shall have no end  mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof  to try an older friend  a god in love  to whom i am confind  then give me welcome  next my heaven the best  even to thy pure and most most loving breast 
 love is my sin  and thy dear virtue hate  hate of my sin  grounded on sinful loving  o  but with mine compare thou thine own state  and thou shalt find it merits not reproving  or  if it do  not from those lips of thine  that have profand their scarlet ornaments and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine  robbd others beds revenues of their rents  be it lawful i love thee  as thou lovst those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee  root pity in thy heart  that  when it grows  thy pity may deserve to pitied be  if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide  by self example mayst thou be denied 
 who will believe my verse in time to come  if it were filld with your most high deserts  though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life  and shows not half your parts  if i could write the beauty of your eyes  and in fresh numbers number all your graces  the age to come would say this poet lies  such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces  so should my papers  yellowd with their age  be scornd  like old men of less truth than tongue  and your true rights be termd a poets rage and stretched metre of an antique song  but were some child of yours alive that time  you should live twice   in it  and in my rhyme 
 two loves i have of comfort and despair  which like two spirits do suggest me still  the better angel is a man right fair  the worser spirit a woman colourd ill  to win me soon to hell  my female evil  tempteth my better angel from my side  and would corrupt my saint to be a devil  wooing his purity with her foul pride  and whether that my angel be turnd fiend  suspect i may  yet not directly tell  but being both from me  both to each friend  i guess one angel in anothers hell  yet this shall i neer know  but live in doubt  till my bad angel fire my good one out 
 if thy soul check thee that i come so near  swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will  and will  thy soul knows  is admitted there  thus far for love  my love suit  sweet  fulfil  will  will fulfil the treasure of thy love  ay  fill it full with wills  and my will one  in things of great receipt with ease we prove among a number one is reckond none  then in the number let me pass untold  though in thy stores account i one must be  for nothing hold me  so it please thee hold that nothing me  a something sweet to thee  make but my name thy love  and love that still  and then thou lovst me for my name is will 
 then let not winters ragged hand deface  in thee thy summer  ere thou be distilld  make sweet some vial  treasure thou some place with beautys treasure ere it be self killd  that use is not forbidden usury  which happies those that pay the willing loan  thats for thy self to breed another thee  or ten times happier  be it ten for one  ten times thy self were happier than thou art  if ten of thine ten times refigurd thee  then what could death do if thou shouldst depart  leaving thee living in posterity  be not self willd  for thou art much too fair to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 
 o  lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me  that you should love after my death   dear love  forget me quite  for you in me can nothing worthy prove  unless you would devise some virtuous lie  to do more for me than mine own desert  and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart  o  lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue  my name be buried where my body is  and live no more to shame nor me nor you  for i am shamed by that which i bring forth  and so should you  to love things nothing worth 
 the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action  and till action  lust is perjurd  murderous  bloody  full of blame  savage  extreme  rude  cruel  not to trust  enjoyd no sooner but despised straight  past reason hunted  and no sooner had  past reason hated  as a swallowd bait  on purpose laid to make the taker mad  mad in pursuit and in possession so  had  having  and in quest  to have extreme  a bliss in proof    and provd  a very woe  before  a joy proposd  behind a dream  all this the world well knows  yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 
 how careful was i when i took my way  each trifle under truest bars to thrust  that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood  in sure wards of trust  but thou  to whom my jewels trifles are  most worthy comfort  now my greatest grief  thou best of dearest  and mine only care  art left the prey of every vulgar thief  thee have i not lockd up in any chest  save where thou art not  though i feel thou art  within the gentle closure of my breast  from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part  and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear  for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 
 for shame  deny that thou bearst love to any  who for thy self art so unprovident  grant  if thou wilt  thou art belovd of many  but that thou none lovst is most evident  for thou art so possessd with murderous hate  that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire  seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire  o  change thy thought  that i may change my mind  shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love  be  as thy presence is  gracious and kind  or to thyself at least kind hearted prove  make thee another self for love of me  that beauty still may live in thine or thee 
 so am i as the rich  whose blessed key  can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure  the which he will not every hour survey  for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure  therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare  since  seldom coming in that long year set  like stones of worth they thinly placed are  or captain jewels in the carcanet  so is the time that keeps you as my chest  or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide  to make some special instant special blest  by new unfolding his imprisond pride  blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope  being had  to triumph  being lacked  to hope 
 ah  wherefore with infection should he live  and with his presence grace impiety  that sin by him advantage should achieve  and lace itself with his society  why should false painting imitate his cheek  and steel dead seeming of his living hue  why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow  since his rose is true  why should he live  now nature bankrupt is  beggard of blood to blush through lively veins  for she hath no exchequer now but his  and proud of many  lives upon his gains  o  him she stores  to show what wealth she had in days long since  before these last so bad 
 thy bosom is endeared with all hearts  which i by lacking have supposed dead  and there reigns love  and all loves loving parts  and all those friends which i thought buried  how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye  as interest of the dead  which now appear but things removd that hidden in thee lie  thou art the grave where buried love doth live  hung with the trophies of my lovers gone  who all their parts of me to thee did give  that due of many now is thine alone  their images i lovd  i view in thee  and thou  all they  hast all the all of me 
 let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments  love is not love which alters when it alteration finds  or bends with the remover to remove  o  no  it is an ever fixed mark  that looks on tempests and is never shaken  it is the star to every wandering bark  whose worths unknown  although his height be taken  loves not times fool  though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come  love alters not with his brief hours and weeks  but bears it out even to the edge of doom  if this be error and upon me provd  i never writ  nor no man ever lovd 
 that god forbid  that made me first your slave  i should in thought control your times of pleasure  or at your hand the account of hours to crave  being your vassal  bound to stay your leisure  o  let me suffer  being at your beck  the imprisond absence of your liberty  and patience  tame to sufferance  bide each check  without accusing you of injury  be where you list  your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will  to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of self doing crime  i am to wait  though waiting so be hell  not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 
 o  for my sake do you with fortune chide  the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds  that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds  thence comes it that my name receives a brand  and almost thence my nature is subdud to what it works in  like the dyers hand  pity me  then  and wish i were renewd  whilst  like a willing patient  i will drink  potions of eisel gainst my strong infection  no bitterness that i will bitter think  nor double penance  to correct correction  pity me then  dear friend  and i assure ye  even that your pity is enough to cure me 
 like as  to make our appetite more keen  with eager compounds we our palate urge  as  to prevent our maladies unseen  we sicken to shun sickness when we purge  even so  being full of your neer cloying sweetness  to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding  and  sick of welfare  found a kind of meetness to be diseasd  ere that there was true needing  thus policy in love  to anticipate the ills that were not  grew to faults assurd  and brought to medicine a healthful state which  rank of goodness  would by ill be curd  but thence i learn and find the lesson true  drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 
 or i shall live your epitaph to make  or you survive when i in earth am rotten  from hence your memory death cannot take  although in me each part will be forgotten  your name from hence immortal life shall have  though i  once gone  to all the world must die  the earth can yield me but a common grave  when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie  your monument shall be my gentle verse  which eyes not yet created shall oer read  and tongues to be  your being shall rehearse  when all the breathers of this world are dead  you still shall live   such virtue hath my pen    where breath most breathes  even in the mouths of men 
 thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste  these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear  and of this book  this learning mayst thou taste  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory  thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know times thievish progress to eternity  look  what thy memory cannot contain  commit to these waste blanks  and thou shalt find those children nursed  deliverd from thy brain  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind  these offices  so oft as thou wilt look  shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 
 so are you to my thoughts as food to life  or as sweet seasond showers are to the ground  and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found  now proud as an enjoyer  and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure  now counting best to be with you alone  then betterd that the world may see my pleasure  sometime all full with feasting on your sight  and by and by clean starved for a look  possessing or pursuing no delight  save what is had  or must from you be took  thus do i pine and surfeit day by day  or gluttoning on all  or all away 
 not from the stars do i my judgement pluck  and yet methinks i have astronomy  but not to tell of good or evil luck  of plagues  of dearths  or seasons quality  nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell  pointing to each his thunder  rain and wind  or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find  but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive  and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive  if from thyself  to store thou wouldst convert  or else of thee this i prognosticate  thy end is truths and beautys doom and date 
 from fairest creatures we desire increase  that thereby beautys rose might never die  but as the riper should by time decease  his tender heir might bear his memory  but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes  feedst thy lights flame with self substantial fuel  making a famine where abundance lies  thy self thy foe  to thy sweet self too cruel  thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament  and only herald to the gaudy spring  within thine own bud buriest thy content  and tender churl makst waste in niggarding  pity the world  or else this glutton be  to eat the worlds due  by the grave and thee 
 let not my love be calld idolatry  nor my beloved as an idol show  since all alike my songs and praises be to one  of one  still such  and ever so  kind is my love to day  to morrow kind  still constant in a wondrous excellence  therefore my verse to constancy confind  one thing expressing  leaves out difference  fair  kind  and true  is all my argument  fair  kind  and true  varying to other words  and in this change is my invention spent  three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords  fair  kind  and true  have often livd alone  which three till now  never kept seat in one 
 alack  what poverty my muse brings forth  that having such a scope to show her pride  the argument  all bare  is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside  o  blame me not  if i no more can write  look in your glass  and there appears a face that over goes my blunt invention quite  dulling my lines  and doing me disgrace  were it not sinful then  striving to mend  to mar the subject that before was well  for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell  and more  much more  than in my verse can sit  your own glass shows you when you look in it 
 canst thou  o cruel  say i love thee not  when i against myself with thee partake  do i not think on thee  when i forgot am of my self  all tyrant  for thy sake  who hateth thee that i do call my friend  on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon  nay  if thou lourst on me  do i not spend revenge upon myself with present moan  what merit do i in my self respect  that is so proud thy service to despise  when all my best doth worship thy defect  commanded by the motion of thine eyes  but  love  hate on  for now i know thy mind  those that can see thou lovst  and i am blind 
 but do thy worst to steal thyself away  for term of life thou art assured mine  and life no longer than thy love will stay  for it depends upon that love of thine  then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs  when in the least of them my life hath end  i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend  thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind  since that my life on thy revolt doth lie  o  what a happy title do i find  happy to have thy love  happy to die  but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot  thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not 
 how can i then return in happy plight  that am debarred the benefit of rest  when days oppression is not easd by night  but day by night and night by day oppressd  and each  though enemies to eithers reign  do in consent shake hands to torture me  the one by toil  the other to complain how far i toil  still farther off from thee  i tell the day  to please him thou art bright  and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven  so flatter i the swart complexiond night  when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even  but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer  and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger 
 i never saw that you did painting need  and therefore to your fair no painting set  i found  or thought i found  you did exceed that barren tender of a poets debt  and therefore have i slept in your report  that you yourself  being extant  well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short  speaking of worth  what worth in you doth grow  this silence for my sin you did impute  which shall be most my glory being dumb  for i impair not beauty being mute  when others would give life  and bring a tomb  there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise 
 farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing  and like enough thou knowst thy estimate  the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing  my bonds in thee are all determinate  for how do i hold thee but by thy granting  and for that riches where is my deserving  the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting  and so my patent back again is swerving  thy self thou gavst  thy own worth then not knowing  or me to whom thou gavst it  else mistaking  so thy great gift  upon misprision growing  comes home again  on better judgement making  thus have i had thee  as a dream doth flatter  in sleep a king  but waking no such matter 
 against my love shall be as i am now  with times injurious hand crushd and oerworn  when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow with lines and wrinkles  when his youthful morn hath travelld on to ages steepy night  and all those beauties whereof now hes king are vanishing  or vanished out of sight  stealing away the treasure of his spring  for such a time do i now fortify against confounding ages cruel knife  that he shall never cut from memory my sweet loves beauty  though my lovers life  his beauty shall in these black lines be seen  and they shall live  and he in them still green 
 your love and pity doth the impression fill  which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow  for what care i who calls me well or ill  so you oer green my bad  my good allow  you are my all the world  and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue  none else to me  nor i to none alive  that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong  in so profound abysm i throw all care of others voices  that my adders sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are  mark how with my neglect i do dispense  you are so strongly in my purpose bred  that all the world besides methinks are dead 
 like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore  so do our minutes hasten to their end  each changing place with that which goes before  in sequent toil all forwards do contend  nativity  once in the main of light  crawls to maturity  wherewith being crownd  crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight  and time that gave doth now his gift confound  time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beautys brow  feeds on the rarities of natures truth  and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow  and yet to times in hope  my verse shall stand  praising thy worth  despite his cruel hand 
 lord of my love  to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit  to thee i send this written embassage  to witness duty  not to show my wit  duty so great  which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare  in wanting words to show it  but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy souls thought  all naked  will bestow it  till whatsoever star that guides my moving  points on me graciously with fair aspect  and puts apparel on my tatterd loving  to show me worthy of thy sweet respect  then may i dare to boast how i do love thee  till then  not show my head where thou mayst prove me 
 take all my loves  my love  yea take them all  what hast thou then more than thou hadst before  no love  my love  that thou mayst true love call  all mine was thine  before thou hadst this more  then  if for my love  thou my love receivest  i cannot blame thee  for my love thou usest  but yet be blamd  if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest  i do forgive thy robbery  gentle thief  although thou steal thee all my poverty  and yet  love knows it is a greater grief to bear loves wrong  than hates known injury  lascivious grace  in whom all ill well shows  kill me with spites yet we must not be foes 
 thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art  as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel  for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel  yet  in good faith  some say that thee behold  thy face hath not the power to make love groan  to say they err i dare not be so bold  although i swear it to myself alone  and to be sure that is not false i swear  a thousand groans  but thinking on thy face  one on anothers neck  do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgments place  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds  and thence this slander  as i think  proceeds 
 they that have power to hurt  and will do none  that do not do the thing they most do show  who  moving others  are themselves as stone  unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow  they rightly do inherit heavens graces  and husband natures riches from expense  they are the lords and owners of their faces  others  but stewards of their excellence  the summers flower is to the summer sweet  though to itself  it only live and die  but if that flower with base infection meet  the basest weed outbraves his dignity  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds  lilies that fester  smell far worse than weeds 
 cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep  a maid of dians this advantage found  and his love kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley fountain of that ground  which borrowd from this holy fire of love  a dateless lively heat  still to endure  and grew a seeting bath  which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure  but at my mistress eye loves brand new fired  the boy for trial needs would touch my breast  i  sick withal  the help of bath desired  and thither hied  a sad distemperd guest  but found no cure  the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire  my mistress eyes 
 if my dear love were but the child of state  it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd  as subject to times love or to times hate  weeds among weeds  or flowers with flowers gatherd  no  it was builded far from accident  it suffers not in smiling pomp  nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent  whereto th inviting time our fashion calls  it fears not policy  that heretic  which works on leases of short numberd hours  but all alone stands hugely politic  that it nor grows with heat  nor drowns with showers  to this i witness call the fools of time  which die for goodness  who have lived for crime 
 whats in the brain  that ink may character  which hath not figurd to thee my true spirit  whats new to speak  what now to register  that may express my love  or thy dear merit  nothing  sweet boy  but yet  like prayers divine  i must each day say oer the very same  counting no old thing old  thou mine  i thine  even as when first i hallowd thy fair name  so that eternal love in loves fresh case  weighs not the dust and injury of age  nor gives to necessary wrinkles place  but makes antiquity for aye his page  finding the first conceit of love there bred  where time and outward form would show it dead 
 where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long  to speak of that which gives thee all thy might  spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song  darkening thy power to lend base subjects light  return forgetful muse  and straight redeem  in gentle numbers time so idly spent  sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument  rise  resty muse  my loves sweet face survey  if time have any wrinkle graven there  if any  be a satire to decay  and make times spoils despised every where  give my love fame faster than time wastes life  so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife 
 that you were once unkind befriends me now  and for that sorrow  which i then did feel  needs must i under my transgression bow  unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel  for if you were by my unkindness shaken  as i by yours  youve passd a hell of time  and i  a tyrant  have no leisure taken to weigh how once i sufferd in your crime  o  that our night of woe might have rememberd my deepest sense  how hard true sorrow hits  and soon to you  as you to me  then tenderd the humble salve  which wounded bosoms fits  but that your trespass now becomes a fee  mine ransoms yours  and yours must ransom me 
 being your slave what should i do but tend  upon the hours  and times of your desire  i have no precious time at all to spend  nor services to do  till you require  nor dare i chide the world without end hour  whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you  nor think the bitterness of absence sour  when you have bid your servant once adieu  nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be  or your affairs suppose  but  like a sad slave  stay and think of nought save  where you are  how happy you make those  so true a fool is love  that in your will  though you do anything  he thinks no ill 
 when thou shalt be disposd to set me light  and place my merit in the eye of scorn  upon thy side  against myself ill fight  and prove thee virtuous  though thou art forsworn  with mine own weakness  being best acquainted  upon thy part i can set down a story of faults conceald  wherein i am attainted  that thou in losing me shalt win much glory  and i by this will be a gainer too  for bending all my loving thoughts on thee  the injuries that to myself i do  doing thee vantage  double vantage me  such is my love  to thee i so belong  that for thy right  myself will bear all wrong 
 betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took  and each doth good turns now unto the other  when that mine eye is famishd for a look  or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother  with my loves picture then my eye doth feast  and to the painted banquet bids my heart  another time mine eye is my hearts guest  and in his thoughts of love doth share a part  so  either by thy picture or my love  thy self away  art present still with me  for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move  and i am still with them  and they with thee  or  if they sleep  thy picture in my sight awakes my heart  to hearts and eyes delight 
 the other two  slight air  and purging fire are both with thee  wherever i abide  the first my thought  the other my desire  these present absent with swift motion slide  for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee  my life  being made of four  with two alone sinks down to death  oppressd with melancholy  until lifes composition be recurd by those swift messengers returnd from thee  who even but now come back again  assurd  of thy fair health  recounting it to me  this told  i joy  but then no longer glad  i send them back again  and straight grow sad 
 when i do count the clock that tells the time  and see the brave day sunk in hideous night  when i behold the violet past prime  and sable curls  all silvered oer with white  when lofty trees i see barren of leaves  which erst from heat did canopy the herd  and summers green all girded up in sheaves  borne on the bier with white and bristly beard  then of thy beauty do i question make  that thou among the wastes of time must go  since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow  and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence save breed  to brave him when he takes thee hence 
 from you have i been absent in the spring  when proud pied april  dressd in all his trim  hath put a spirit of youth in every thing  that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him  yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue  could make me any summers story tell  or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew  nor did i wonder at the lilys white  nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose  they were but sweet  but figures of delight  drawn after you  you pattern of all those  yet seemd it winter still  and you away  as with your shadow i with these did play 
 those lips that loves own hand did make  breathed forth the sound that said i hate  to me that languishd for her sake  but when she saw my woeful state  straight in her heart did mercy come  chiding that tongue that ever sweet was usd in giving gentle doom  and taught it thus anew to greet  i hate she alterd with an end  that followed it as gentle day  doth follow night  who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away  i hate  from hate away she threw  and savd my life  saying not you 
 so shall i live  supposing thou art true  like a deceived husband  so loves face may still seem love to me  though alterd new  thy looks with me  thy heart in other place  for there can live no hatred in thine eye  therefore in that i cannot know thy change  in manys looks  the false hearts history is writ in moods  and frowns  and wrinkles strange  but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell  whateer thy thoughts  or thy hearts workings be  thy looks should nothing thence  but sweetness tell  how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
