 why should your fair eyes with such sovreign grace disperse their rays on every vulgar spirit  whilst i in darkness in the self same place  get not one glance to recompense my merit  so doth the plowman gaze the wandring star  and only rest contented with the light  that never learned what constellations are  beyond the bent of his unknowing sight  o why should beauty  custom to obey  to their gross sense apply herself so ill  would god i were as ignorant as they  when i am made unhappy by my skill  only compelled on this poor good to boast  heavens are not kind to them that know them most 
 the raging sea within his limits lies and with an ebb his flowing doth discharge  the rivers when beyond their bounds they rise  themselves do empty in the ocean large  but my loves sea which never limit keepeth  which never ebbs but always ever floweth  in liquid salt unto my chloris weepeth  yet frustrate are the tears which he bestoweth  this sea which first was but a little spring is now so great and far beyond all reason  that it a deluge to my thoughts doth bring  which overwhelmed hath my joying season  so hard and dry is my saints cruel mind  these waves no way in her to sink can find 
 though they augmenters of my thraldom be  for her i live and her i love and none else  o then  fair eyes  look mildly upon me  who poor  despised  forlorn must live alone else  and like amintas haunt the desert cells  and moanless there breathe out thy cruelty  where none but care and melancholy dwells  i for revenge to nemesis will cry  if that will not prevail  my wandering ghost  which breathless here this love scorched trunk shall leave  shall unto thee with tragic tidings post  how thy disdain did life from soul bereave  then all too late my death thou wilt repent  when murthers guilt thy conscience shall torment

 most true that i must fair fidessa love  most true that fair fidessa cannot love  most true that i do feel the pains of love  most true that i am captive unto love  most true that i deluded am with love  most true that i do find the sleights of love  most true that nothing can procure her love  most true that i must perish in my love  most true that she contemns the god of love  most true that he is snared with her love  most true that she would have me cease to love  most true that she herself alone is love  most true that though she hated  i would love  most true that dearest life shall end with love 
 you best discerned of my minds inward eyes  and yet your graces outwardly divine  whose dear remembrance in my bosom lies  too rich a relic for so poor a shrine  you  in whom nature chose herself to view  when she her own perfection would admire  bestowing all her excellence on you  at whose pure eyes love lights his hallowed fire  even as a man that in some trance hath seen more than his wondring utterance can unfold  that rapt in spirit in better worlds hath been  so must your praise distractedly be told  most of all short when i would show you most  in your perfections so much am i lost 
 you cannot love  my pretty heart  and why  there was a time you told me that you would  but how again you will the same deny  if it might please you  would to god you could  what  will you hate  nay  that you will not neither  nor love  nor hate  how then  what will you do  what  will you keep a mean then betwixt either  or will you love me  and yet hate me too  yet serves not this  what next  what other shift  you will  and will not  what a coil is here  i see your craft  now i perceive your drift  and all this while i was mistaken there  your love and hate is this  i now do prove you  you love in hate  by hate to make me love you 
 as love and i late harboured in one inn  with proverbs thus each other entertain  in love there is no lack  thus i begin  fair words make fools  replieth he again  who spares to speak  doth spare to speed  quoth i  as well  saith he   too forward as too slow   fortune assists the boldest  i reply  a hasty man  quoth he   neer wanted woe   labour is light  where love  quoth i   doth pay   saith he   light burdens heavy  if far born   quoth i   the main lost  cast the by away   you have spun a fair thread  he replies in scorn  and having thus awhile each other thwarted  fools as we met  so fools again we parted 
 some men there be which like my method well  and much commend the strangeness of my vein  some say i have a passing pleasing strain  some say that in my humour i excel  some who not kindly relish my conceit  they say  as poets do  i use to feign  and in bare words paint out by passions pain  thus sundry men their sundry minds repeat  i pass not  i  how men affected be  nor who commends or discommends my verse  it pleaseth me if i my woes rehearse  and in my lines if she my love may see  only my comfort still consists in this  writing her praise i cannot write amiss 
 some  when in rhyme they of their loves do tell  with flames and lightnings their exordiums paint  some call on heaven  some invocate on hell  and fates and furies  with their woes acquaint  elizium is too high a seat for me  i will not come in styx or phlegethon  the thrice three muses but too wanton be  like they that lust  i care not  i will none  spiteful erinnys frights me with her looks  my manhood dares not with foul ate mell  i quake to look on hecates charming books  i still fear bugbears in apollos cell  i pass not for minerva  nor astrea  only i call on my divine idea

 an evil spirit  your beauty  haunts me still  wherewith  alas  i have been long possessed  which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill  nor give me once but one poor minutes rest  in me it speaks whether i sleep or wake  and when by means to drive it out i try  with greater torments then it me doth take  and tortures me in most extremity  before my face it lays down my despairs  and hastes me on unto a sudden death  now tempting me to drown myself in tears  and then in sighing to give up my breath  thus am i still provoked to every evil  by this good wicked spirit  sweet angel devil 
 the phoenix fair which rich arabia breeds  when wasting time expires her tragedy  no more on phoebus radiant rays she feeds  but heapeth up great store of spicery  and on a lofty towering cedar tree  with heavenly substance she herself consumes  from whence she young again appears to be  out of the cinders of her peerless plumes  so i which long have fried in loves flame  the fire not made of spice but sighs and tears  revive again in hope disdain to shame  and put to flight the author of my fears  her eyes revive decaying life in me  though they augmenters of my thraldom be 
 i have not spent the april of my time  the sweet of youth in plotting in the air  but do at first adventure seek to climb  whilst flowers of blooming years are green and fair  i am no leaving of all withering age  i have not suffered many winter lours  i feel no storm unless my love do rage  and then in grief i spend both days and hours  this yet doth comfort that my flower lasted until it did approach my sun too near  and then  alas  untimely was it blasted  so soon as once thy beauty did appear  but after all  my comfort rests in this  that for thy sake my youth decayed is 
 the prison i am in is thy fair face  wherein my liberty enchained lies  my thoughts  the bolts that hold me in the place  my food  the pleasing looks of thy fair eyes  deep is the prison where i lie enclosed  strong are the bolts that in this cell contain me  sharp is the food necessity imposed  when hunger makes me feed on that which pains me  yet do i love  embrace  and follow fast  that holds  that keeps  that discontents me most  and list not break  unlock  or seek to waste the place  the bolts  the food  though i be lost  better in prison ever to remain  than being out to suffer greater pain 
 venus  and young adonis sitting by her  under a myrtle shade  began to woo him  she told the youngling how god mars did try her  and as he fell to her  so fell she to him  even thus  quoth she   the wanton god embraced me   and then she clasped adonis in her arms  even thus  quoth she   the warlike god unlaced me   as if the boy should use like loving charms  but he  a wayward boy  refused the offer  and ran away the beauteous queen neglecting showing both folly to abuse her proffer  and all his sex of cowardice detecting  o that i had my mistress at that bay  to kiss and clip me till i ran away 
 do i unto a cruel tiger play  that preys on me as wolf upon the lambs  who fear the danger both of night and day and run for succour to their tender dams  yet will i pray  though she be ever cruel  on bended knee and with submissive heart  she is the fire and i must be the fuel  she must inflict and i endure the smart  she must  she shall be mistress of her will  and i  poor i  obedient to the same  as fit to suffer death as she to kill  as ready to be blamed as she to blame  and for i am the subject of her ire  all men shall know thereby my love entire 
 it was of love  ungentle gentle boy  that thou didst come and harbour in my breast  not of intent my body to destroy  and have my soul  with restless cares opprest  but sith thy love doth turn unto my pain  return to greece  sweet lad  where thou wast born  leave me alone my griefs to entertain  if thou forsake me  i am less forlorn  although alone  yet shall i find more ease  then see thou hie thee hence  or i will chase thee  men highly wronged care not to displease  my fortune hangs on thee  thou dost disgrace me  yet at thy farewell  play a friendly part  to make amends  fly to fidessas heart 
 compare me to pygmalion with his image sotted  for  as was he  even so am i deceived  the shadow only is to me allotted  the substance hath of substance me bereaved  then poor and helpless must i wander still in deep laments to pass succeeding days  weltring in woes that poor and mighty kill  o who is mighty that so soon decays  the dread almighty hath appointed so the final period of all worldly things  then as in time they come  so must they go  death common is to beggars and to kings for whither do i run beside my text  i run to death  for death must be the next 
 some misbelieving and profane in love  when i do speak of miracles by thee  may say that thou art flattered by me  who only write my skill in verse to prove see miracles  ye unbelieving  see  a dumb born muse made to express the mind  a cripple hand to write  yet lame by kind  one by thy name  the other touching thee  blind were mine eyes  till they were seen of thine  and mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be  my vices cured by virtues sprung from thee  my hopes revived which long in grave had lien  all unclean thoughts  foul spirits  cast out in me  only by virtue that proceeds from thee 
 my heart the anvil where my thoughts do beat  my words the hammers fashioning my desire  my breast the forge including all the heat  love is the fuel which maintains the fire  my sighs the bellows which the flame increaseth  filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning  toiling with pain  my labour never ceaseth  in grievous passions my woes still bemoaning  my eyes with tears against the fire striving  whose scorching gleed my heart to cinders turneth  but with those drops the flame again reviving  still more and more it to my torment burneth  with sisyphus thus do i roll the stone  and turn the wheel with damned ixion 
 thou leaden brain  which censurst what i write  and sayst my lines be dull and do not move  i marvel not thou feelst not my delight  which never feltst my fiery touch of love  but thou whose pen hath like a packhorse served  whose stomach unto gall hath turned thy food  whose senses like poor prisoners  hunger starved whose grief hath parched thy body  dried thy blood  thou which hast scorned life and hated death  and in a moment  mad  sober  glad  and sorry  thou which hast banned thy thoughts and curst thy birth with thousand plagues more than in purgatory  thou thus whose spirit love in his fire refines  come thou and read  admire  applaud my lines 
 these waves no way in her to sink can find to penetrate the pith of contemplation  these tears cannot dissolve her hardened mind  nor move her heart on me to take compassion  o then  poor corin  scorned and quite despised  loathe now to live since life procures thy woe  enough  thou hast thy heart anatomised  for her sweet sake which will no pity show  but as cold winters storms and nipping frost can never change sweet aramanthus hue  so though my love and life by her are crossed  my heart shall still be constant firm and true  although erynnis hinders hymens rites  my fixed faith against oblivion fights 
 is not love here as tis in other climes  and differeth it as do the several nations  or hath it lost the virtue with the times  or in this island altreth with the fashions  or have our passions lesser power than theirs  who had less art them lively to express  is nature grown less powerful in their heirs  or in our fathers did she more transgress  i am sure my sighs come from a heart as true as any mans that memory can boast  and my respects and services to you  equal with his that loves his mistress most  or nature must be partial in my cause  or only you do violate her laws 
 when chloris first with her heart robbing eye inchanted had my silly senses all  i little did respect loves cruelty  i never thought his snares should me enthrall  but since her tresses have entangled me  my pining flock did never hear me sing those jolly notes which erst did make them glee  nor do my kids about me leap and spring as they were wont  but when they hear me cry they likewise cry and fill the air with bleating  then do my sheep upon the cold earth lie  and feed no more  my griefs they are repeating  o chloris  if thou then sawst them and me im sure thou wouldst both pity them and me 
 why do i speak of joy or write of love  when my heart is the very den of horror  and in my soul the pains of hell i prove  with all his torments and infernal terror  what should i say  what yet remains to do  my brain is dry with weeping all too long  my sighs be spent in uttring of my woe  and i want words wherewith to tell my wrong  but still distracted in loves lunacy  and bedlam like thus raving in my grief  now rail upon her hair  then on her eye  now call her goddess  then i call her thief  now i deny her  then i do confess her  now do i curse her  then again i bless her 
 arraigned  poor captive at the bar i stand  the bar of beauty  bar to all my joys  and up i hold my ever trembling hand  wishing or life or death to end annoys  and when the judge doth question of the guilt  and bids me speak  then sorrow shuts up words  yea  though he say   speak boldly what thou wilt   yet my confused affects no speech affords  for why  alas  my passions have no bound  for fear of death that penetrates so near  and still one grief another doth confound  yet doth at length a way to speech appear  then  for i speak too late  the judge doth give his sentence that in prison i shall live 
 i see  i hear  i feel  i know  i rue my fate  my fame  my pain  my loss  my fall  mishap  reproach  disdain  a crown  her hue  cruel  still flying  false  fair  funeral  to cross  to shame  bewitch  deceive  and kill my first proceedings in their flowing bloom  my worthless pen fast chained to my will  my erring life through an uncertain doom  my thoughts that yet in lowliness do mount  my heart the subject of her tyranny  what now remains but her severe account of murders crying guilt  foul butchery  she was unhappy in her cradle breath  that given was to be anothers death 
 grief urging guest  great cause have i to plain me  yet hope persuading hope expecteth grace  and saith none but myself shall ever pain me  but grief my hopes exceedeth in this case  for still my fortune ever more doth cross me by worse events than ever i expected  and here and there ten thousand ways doth toss me  with sad remembrance of my time neglected  these breed such thoughts as set my heart on fire  and like fell hounds pursue me to my death  traitors unto their sovereign lord and sire  unkind exactors of their fathers breath  whom in their rage they shall no sooner kill than they themselves themselves unjustly spill
