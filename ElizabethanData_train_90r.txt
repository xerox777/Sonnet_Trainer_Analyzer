 o if my heavenly sighs must prove annoy  which are the sweetest music to my heart  let it suffice i count them as my joy  sweet bitter joy and pleasant painful smart  for when my breast is clogged with thousand cares  that my poor loaded heart is like to break  then every sigh doth question how it fares  seeming to add their strength  which makes me weak  yet for they friendly are  i entertain them  and they too well are pleased with their host  but i  had not fidessa been  ere now had slain them  its for her cause they live  in her they boast  they promise help but when they see her face  they fainting yield  and dare not sue for grace 
 why do i speak of joy or write of love  when my heart is the very den of horror  and in my soul the pains of hell i prove  with all his torments and infernal terror  what should i say  what yet remains to do  my brain is dry with weeping all too long  my sighs be spent in uttring of my woe  and i want words wherewith to tell my wrong  but still distracted in loves lunacy  and bedlam like thus raving in my grief  now rail upon her hair  then on her eye  now call her goddess  then i call her thief  now i deny her  then i do confess her  now do i curse her  then again i bless her

 injurious fates  to rob me of my bliss  and dispossess my heart of all his hope  you ought with just revenge to punish miss  for unto you the hearts of men are ope  injurious fates  that hardened have her heart  yet make her face to send out pleasing smiles  and both are done but to increase my smart  and entertain my love with falsed wiles  yet being when she smiles surprised with joy  i fain would languish in so sweet a pain  beseeching death my body to destroy  lest on the sudden she should frown again  when men do wish for death  fates have no force  but they  when men would live  have no remorse 
 when chloris first with her heart robbing eye inchanted had my silly senses all  i little did respect loves cruelty  i never thought his snares should me enthrall  but since her tresses have entangled me  my pining flock did never hear me sing those jolly notes which erst did make them glee  nor do my kids about me leap and spring as they were wont  but when they hear me cry they likewise cry and fill the air with bleating  then do my sheep upon the cold earth lie  and feed no more  my griefs they are repeating  o chloris  if thou then sawst them and me im sure thou wouldst both pity them and me

 my love  i cannot thy rare beauties place under those forms which many writers use  some like to stones compare their mistress face  some in the name of flowers do love abuse  some makes their love a goldsmiths shop to be  where orient pearls and precious stones abound  in my conceit these far do disagree the perfect praise of beauty forth to sound  o chloris  thou dost imitate thyself  selfs imitating passeth precious stones  or all the eastern indian golden pelf  thy red and white with purest fair atones  matchless for beauty nature hath thee framed  only unkind and cruel thou art named

 o  why should nature niggardly restrain that foreign nations relish not our tongue  else should my lines glide on the waves of rhine  and crown the pyrens with my living song  but bounded thus  to scotland get you forth  thence take you wing unto the orcades  there let my verse get glory in the north  making my sighs to thaw the frozen seas  and let the bards within that irish isle  to whom my muse with fiery wings shall pass  call back the stiff necked rebels from exile  and mollify the slaughtering gallowglass  and when my flowing numbers they rehearse  let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse 
 the perils which leander took in hand fair heros love and favour to obtain  when void of fear securely leaving land  through hellespont he swam to cestos main  his dangers should not counterpoise my toil  if my dear love would once but pity show  to quench these flames which in my breast do broil  or dry these springs which from mine eyes do flow  not only hellespont but ocean seas  for her sweet sake to ford i would attempt  so that my travels would her ire appease  my soul from thrall and languish to exempt  o what ist not poor i would undertake  if labour could my peace with chloris make 
 sitting alone  love bids me go and write  reason plucks back  commanding me to stay  boasting that she doth still direct the way  or else love were unable to indite  love growing angry  vexed at the spleen  and scorning reasons maimed argument  straight taxeth reason  wanting to invent where she with love conversing hath not been  reason reproached with this coy disdain  despiteth love  and laugheth at her folly  and love contemning reasons reason wholly  thought it in weight too light by many a grain  reason put back doth out of sight remove  and love alone picks reason out of love 
 you lofty pines  co partners of my woe  when chloris sitteth underneath your shade  to her those sighs and tears i pray you show  whilst you attending i for her have made  whilst you attending  dropped have sweet balm in token that you pity my distress  zephirus hath your stately boughs made calm  whilst i to you my sorrows did express  the neighbour mountains bended have their tops  when they have heard my rueful melody  and elves in rings about me leaps and hops  to frame my passions to their jollity  resounding echoes from their obscure caves  reiterate what most my fancy craves 
 you fawns and silvans  when my chloris brings her flocks to water in your pleasant plains  solicit her to pity corins strings  the smart whereof for her he still sustains  for she is ruthless of my woeful song  my oaten reed she not delights to hear  o chloris  chloris  corin thou dost wrong  who loves thee better than his own heart dear  the flames of aetna are not half so hot as is the fire which thy disdain hath bread  ah cruel fates  why do you then besot poor corins soul with love  when love is fled  either cause cruel chloris to relent  or let me die upon the wound she sent 
 my heart was slain  and none but you and i  who should i think the murder should commit  since but yourself there was no creature by but only i  guiltless of murdering it  it slew itself  the verdict on the view do quit the dead  and me not accessary  well  well  i fear it will be proved by you  the evidence so great a proof doth carry  but o see  see  we need inquire no further  upon your lips the scarlet drops are found  and in your eye the boy that did the murder  your cheeks yet pale since first he gave the wound  by this i see  however things be past  yet heaven will still have murder out at last
