 if there be nothing new  but that which is hath been before  how are our brains beguild  which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child  o  that record could with a backward look  even of five hundred courses of the sun  show me your image in some antique book  since mind at first in character was done  that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame  whr we are mended  or whr better they  or whether revolution be the same  o  sure i am the wits of former days  to subjects worse have given admiring praise 
 what potions have i drunk of siren tears  distilld from limbecks foul as hell within  applying fears to hopes  and hopes to fears  still losing when i saw myself to win  what wretched errors hath my heart committed  whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never  how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted  in the distraction of this madding fever  o benefit of ill  now i find true that better is  by evil still made better  and ruind love  when it is built anew  grows fairer than at first  more strong  far greater  so i return rebukd to my content  and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent 
 o me  what eyes hath love put in my head  which have no correspondence with true sight  or  if they have  where is my judgment fled  that censures falsely what they see aright  if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote  what means the world to say it is not so  if it be not  then love doth well denote loves eye is not so true as all mens  no  how can it  o  how can loves eye be true  that is so vexed with watching and with tears  no marvel then  though i mistake my view  the sun itself sees not  till heaven clears  o cunning love  with tears thou keepst me blind  lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find 
 the other two  slight air  and purging fire are both with thee  wherever i abide  the first my thought  the other my desire  these present absent with swift motion slide  for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee  my life  being made of four  with two alone sinks down to death  oppressd with melancholy  until lifes composition be recurd by those swift messengers returnd from thee  who even but now come back again  assurd  of thy fair health  recounting it to me  this told  i joy  but then no longer glad  i send them back again  and straight grow sad 
 how heavy do i journey on the way  when what i seek  my weary travels end  doth teach that ease and that repose to say  thus far the miles are measured from thy friend  the beast that bears me  tired with my woe  plods dully on  to bear that weight in me  as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lovd not speed  being made from thee  the bloody spur cannot provoke him on  that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide  which heavily he answers with a groan  more sharp to me than spurring to his side  for that same groan doth put this in my mind  my grief lies onward  and my joy behind 
 but do thy worst to steal thyself away  for term of life thou art assured mine  and life no longer than thy love will stay  for it depends upon that love of thine  then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs  when in the least of them my life hath end  i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend  thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind  since that my life on thy revolt doth lie  o  what a happy title do i find  happy to have thy love  happy to die  but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot  thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not 
 or i shall live your epitaph to make  or you survive when i in earth am rotten  from hence your memory death cannot take  although in me each part will be forgotten  your name from hence immortal life shall have  though i  once gone  to all the world must die  the earth can yield me but a common grave  when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie  your monument shall be my gentle verse  which eyes not yet created shall oer read  and tongues to be  your being shall rehearse  when all the breathers of this world are dead  you still shall live   such virtue hath my pen    where breath most breathes  even in the mouths of men 
 lo  in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head  each under eye doth homage to his new appearing sight  serving with looks his sacred majesty  and having climbd the steep up heavenly hill  resembling strong youth in his middle age  yet mortal looks adore his beauty still  attending on his golden pilgrimage  but when from highmost pitch  with weary car  like feeble age  he reeleth from the day  the eyes  fore duteous  now converted are from his low tract  and look another way  so thou  thyself outgoing in thy noon  unlookd  on diest unless thou get a son 
 so is it not with me as with that muse  stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse  who heaven itself for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse  making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon  with earth and seas rich gems  with aprils first born flowers  and all things rare  that heavens air in this huge rondure hems  o  let me  true in love  but truly write  and then believe me  my love is as fair as any mothers child  though not so bright as those gold candles fixd in heavens air  let them say more that like of hearsay well  i will not praise that purpose not to sell 
 that god forbid  that made me first your slave  i should in thought control your times of pleasure  or at your hand the account of hours to crave  being your vassal  bound to stay your leisure  o  let me suffer  being at your beck  the imprisond absence of your liberty  and patience  tame to sufferance  bide each check  without accusing you of injury  be where you list  your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will  to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of self doing crime  i am to wait  though waiting so be hell  not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 
 whoever hath her wish  thou hast thy will  and will to boot  and will in over plus  more than enough am i that vexd thee still  to thy sweet will making addition thus  wilt thou  whose will is large and spacious  not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine  shall will in others seem right gracious  and in my will no fair acceptance shine  the sea  all water  yet receives rain still  and in abundance addeth to his store  so thou  being rich in will  add to thy will one will of mine  to make thy large will more  let no unkind no fair beseechers kill  think all but one  and me in that one will 
 thus is his cheek the map of days outworn  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now  before these bastard signs of fair were born  or durst inhabit on a living brow  before the golden tresses of the dead  the right of sepulchres  were shorn away  to live a second life on second head  ere beautys dead fleece made another gay  in him those holy antique hours are seen  without all ornament  itself and true  making no summer of anothers green  robbing no old to dress his beauty new  and him as for a map doth nature store  to show false art what beauty was of yore 
 who will believe my verse in time to come  if it were filld with your most high deserts  though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life  and shows not half your parts  if i could write the beauty of your eyes  and in fresh numbers number all your graces  the age to come would say this poet lies  such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces  so should my papers  yellowd with their age  be scornd  like old men of less truth than tongue  and your true rights be termd a poets rage and stretched metre of an antique song  but were some child of yours alive that time  you should live twice   in it  and in my rhyme 
 mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld  thy beautys form in table of my heart  my body is the frame wherein tis held  and perspective it is best painters art  for through the painter must you see his skill  to find where your true image picturd lies  which in my bosoms shop is hanging still  that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes  now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done  mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for me are windows to my breast  where through the sun delights to peep  to gaze therein on thee  yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art  they draw but what they see  know not the heart 
 thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art  as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel  for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel  yet  in good faith  some say that thee behold  thy face hath not the power to make love groan  to say they err i dare not be so bold  although i swear it to myself alone  and to be sure that is not false i swear  a thousand groans  but thinking on thy face  one on anothers neck  do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgments place  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds  and thence this slander  as i think  proceeds 
 when i have seen by times fell hand defacd the rich proud cost of outworn buried age  when sometime lofty towers i see down razd  and brass eternal slave to mortal rage  when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore  and the firm soil win of the watery main  increasing store with loss  and loss with store  when i have seen such interchange of state  or state itself confounded  to decay  ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate   that time will come and take my love away  this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have  that which it fears to lose 
 let me confess that we two must be twain  although our undivided loves are one  so shall those blots that do with me remain  without thy help  by me be borne alone  in our two loves there is but one respect  though in our lives a separable spite  which though it alter not loves sole effect  yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight  i may not evermore acknowledge thee  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame  nor thou with public kindness honour me  unless thou take that honour from thy name  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as thou being mine  mine is thy good report 
 let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast  whilst i  whom fortune of such triumph bars unlookd for joy in that i honour most  great princes favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the suns eye  and in themselves their pride lies buried  for at a frown they in their glory die  the painful warrior famoused for fight  after a thousand victories once foild  is from the book of honour razed quite  and all the rest forgot for which he toild  then happy i  that love and am belovd  where i may not remove nor be removd 
 love is too young to know what conscience is  yet who knows not conscience is born of love  then  gentle cheater  urge not my amiss  lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove  for  thou betraying me  i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason  my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason  but rising at thy name doth point out thee  as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride  he is contented thy poor drudge to be  to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side  no want of conscience hold it that i call her love  for whose dear love i rise and fall 
 like as  to make our appetite more keen  with eager compounds we our palate urge  as  to prevent our maladies unseen  we sicken to shun sickness when we purge  even so  being full of your neer cloying sweetness  to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding  and  sick of welfare  found a kind of meetness to be diseasd  ere that there was true needing  thus policy in love  to anticipate the ills that were not  grew to faults assurd  and brought to medicine a healthful state which  rank of goodness  would by ill be curd  but thence i learn and find the lesson true  drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 
 sweet love  renew thy force  be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite  which but to day by feeding is allayd  to morrow sharpened in his former might  so  love  be thou  although to day thou fill thy hungry eyes  even till they wink with fulness  to morrow see again  and do not kill the spirit of love  with a perpetual dulness  let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore  where two contracted new come daily to the banks  that when they see return of love  more blest may be the view  or call it winter  which being full of care  makes summers welcome  thrice more wished  more rare 
 tired with all these  for restful death i cry  as to behold desert a beggar born  and needy nothing trimmd in jollity  and purest faith unhappily forsworn  and gilded honour shamefully misplacd  and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted  and right perfection wrongfully disgracd  and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority  and folly  doctor like  controlling skill  and simple truth miscalld simplicity  and captive good attending captain ill  tird with all these  from these would i be gone  save that  to die  i leave my love alone 
 being your slave what should i do but tend  upon the hours  and times of your desire  i have no precious time at all to spend  nor services to do  till you require  nor dare i chide the world without end hour  whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you  nor think the bitterness of absence sour  when you have bid your servant once adieu  nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be  or your affairs suppose  but  like a sad slave  stay and think of nought save  where you are  how happy you make those  so true a fool is love  that in your will  though you do anything  he thinks no ill 
 ah  wherefore with infection should he live  and with his presence grace impiety  that sin by him advantage should achieve  and lace itself with his society  why should false painting imitate his cheek  and steel dead seeming of his living hue  why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow  since his rose is true  why should he live  now nature bankrupt is  beggard of blood to blush through lively veins  for she hath no exchequer now but his  and proud of many  lives upon his gains  o  him she stores  to show what wealth she had in days long since  before these last so bad 
 those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend  all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due  uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend  thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd  but those same tongues  that give thee so thine own  in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown  they look into the beauty of thy mind  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds  then  churls  their thoughts  although their eyes were kind  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show  the soil is this  that thou dost common grow 
 when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment  that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment  when i perceive that men as plants increase  cheered and checked even by the self same sky  vaunt in their youthful sap  at height decrease  and wear their brave state out of memory  then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight  where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night  and all in war with time for love of you  as he takes from you  i engraft you new 
 two loves i have of comfort and despair  which like two spirits do suggest me still  the better angel is a man right fair  the worser spirit a woman colourd ill  to win me soon to hell  my female evil  tempteth my better angel from my side  and would corrupt my saint to be a devil  wooing his purity with her foul pride  and whether that my angel be turnd fiend  suspect i may  yet not directly tell  but being both from me  both to each friend  i guess one angel in anothers hell  yet this shall i neer know  but live in doubt  till my bad angel fire my good one out 
 from you have i been absent in the spring  when proud pied april  dressd in all his trim  hath put a spirit of youth in every thing  that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him  yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue  could make me any summers story tell  or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew  nor did i wonder at the lilys white  nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose  they were but sweet  but figures of delight  drawn after you  you pattern of all those  yet seemd it winter still  and you away  as with your shadow i with these did play 
 where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long  to speak of that which gives thee all thy might  spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song  darkening thy power to lend base subjects light  return forgetful muse  and straight redeem  in gentle numbers time so idly spent  sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument  rise  resty muse  my loves sweet face survey  if time have any wrinkle graven there  if any  be a satire to decay  and make times spoils despised every where  give my love fame faster than time wastes life  so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife 
 when my love swears that she is made of truth  i do believe her though i know she lies  that she might think me some untutord youth  unlearned in the worlds false subtleties  thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young  although she knows my days are past the best  simply i credit her false speaking tongue  on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed  but wherefore says she not she is unjust  and wherefore say not i that i am old  o  loves best habit is in seeming trust  and age in love  loves not to have years told  therefore i lie with her  and she with me  and in our faults by lies we flatterd be 
 was it the proud full sail of his great verse  bound for the prize of all too precious you  that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse  making their tomb the womb wherein they grew  was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write  above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead  no  neither he  nor his compeers by night giving him aid  my verse astonished  he  nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence  as victors of my silence cannot boast  i was not sick of any fear from thence  but when your countenance filld up his line  then lacked i matter  that enfeebled mine 
 that thou art blamd shall not be thy defect  for slanders mark was ever yet the fair  the ornament of beauty is suspect  a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air  so thou be good  slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wood of time  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love  and thou presentst a pure unstained prime  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assaild  or victor being chargd  yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise  to tie up envy  evermore enlargd  if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show  then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 
 say that thou didst forsake me for some fault  and i will comment upon that offence  speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt  against thy reasons making no defence  thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill  to set a form upon desired change  as ill myself disgrace  knowing thy will  i will acquaintance strangle  and look strange  be absent from thy walks  and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell  lest i  too much profane  should do it wrong  and haply of our old acquaintance tell  for thee  against my self ill vow debate  for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate 
 thou blind fool  love  what dost thou to mine eyes  that they behold  and see not what they see  they know what beauty is  see where it lies  yet what the best is take the worst to be  if eyes  corrupt by over partial looks  be anchord in the bay where all men ride  why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks  whereto the judgment of my heart is tied  why should my heart think that a several plot  which my heart knows the wide worlds common place  or mine eyes  seeing this  say this is not  to put fair truth upon so foul a face  in things right true my heart and eyes have errd  and to this false plague are they now transferrd 
 whilst i alone did call upon thy aid  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace  but now my gracious numbers are decayd  and my sick muse doth give an other place  i grant  sweet love  thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of  and pays it thee again  he lends thee virtue  and he stole that word from thy behaviour  beauty doth he give  and found it in thy cheek  he can afford no praise to thee  but what in thee doth live  then thank him not for that which he doth say  since what he owes thee  thou thyself dost pay 
 how can my muse want subject to invent  while thou dost breathe  that pourst into my verse thine own sweet argument  too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse  o  give thy self the thanks  if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight  for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee  when thou thy self dost give invention light  be thou the tenth muse  ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate  and he that calls on thee  let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date  if my slight muse do please these curious days  the pain be mine  but thine shall be the praise 
 no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell  nay  if you read this line  remember not the hand that writ it  for i love you so  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot  if thinking on me then should make you woe  o  if   i say you look upon this verse  when i perhaps compounded am with clay  do not so much as my poor name rehearse  but let your love even with my life decay  lest the wise world should look into your moan  and mock you with me after i am gone 
 is it for fear to wet a widows eye  that thou consumst thy self in single life  ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die  the world will wail thee like a makeless wife  the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind  when every private widow well may keep by childrens eyes  her husbands shape in mind  look  what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it  but beautys waste hath in the world an end  and kept unused the user so destroys it  no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murdrous shame commits 
 then let not winters ragged hand deface  in thee thy summer  ere thou be distilld  make sweet some vial  treasure thou some place with beautys treasure ere it be self killd  that use is not forbidden usury  which happies those that pay the willing loan  thats for thy self to breed another thee  or ten times happier  be it ten for one  ten times thy self were happier than thou art  if ten of thine ten times refigurd thee  then what could death do if thou shouldst depart  leaving thee living in posterity  be not self willd  for thou art much too fair to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 
 o  how i faint when i of you do write  knowing a better spirit doth use your name  and in the praise thereof spends all his might  to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame  but since your worth  wide as the ocean is    the humble as the proudest sail doth bear  my saucy bark  inferior far to his  on your broad main doth wilfully appear  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride  or  being wrackd  i am a worthless boat  he of tall building  and of goodly pride  then if he thrive and i be cast away  the worst was this   my love was my decay 
 so  now i have confessd that he is thine  and i my self am mortgagd to thy will  myself ill forfeit  so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still  but thou wilt not  nor he will not be free  for thou art covetous  and he is kind  he learnd but surety like to write for me  under that bond that him as fast doth bind  the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take  thou usurer  that puttst forth all to use  and sue a friend came debtor for my sake  so him i lose through my unkind abuse  him have i lost  thou hast both him and me  he pays the whole  and yet am i not free 
 but be contented  when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away  my life hath in this line some interest  which for memorial still with thee shall stay  when thou reviewest this  thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee  the earth can have but earth  which is his due  my spirit is thine  the better part of me  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life  the prey of worms  my body being dead  the coward conquest of a wretchs knife  too base of thee to be remembered  the worth of that is that which it contains  and that is this  and this with thee remains 
 when i do count the clock that tells the time  and see the brave day sunk in hideous night  when i behold the violet past prime  and sable curls  all silvered oer with white  when lofty trees i see barren of leaves  which erst from heat did canopy the herd  and summers green all girded up in sheaves  borne on the bier with white and bristly beard  then of thy beauty do i question make  that thou among the wastes of time must go  since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow  and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence save breed  to brave him when he takes thee hence 
 devouring time  blunt thou the lions paws  and make the earth devour her own sweet brood  pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws  and burn the long livd phoenix  in her blood  make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets  and do whateer thou wilt  swift footed time  to the wide world and all her fading sweets  but i forbid thee one most heinous crime  o  carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen  him in thy course untainted do allow for beautys pattern to succeeding men  yet  do thy worst old time  despite thy wrong  my love shall in my verse ever live young 
 o thou  my lovely boy  who in thy power dost hold times fickle glass  his fickle hour  who hast by waning grown  and therein showst thy lovers withering  as thy sweet self growst  if nature  sovereign mistress over wrack  as thou goest onwards  still will pluck thee back  she keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill  yet fear her  o thou minion of her pleasure  she may detain  but not still keep  her treasure  her audit  though delayed  answered must be  and her quietus is to render thee 
 so are you to my thoughts as food to life  or as sweet seasond showers are to the ground  and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found  now proud as an enjoyer  and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure  now counting best to be with you alone  then betterd that the world may see my pleasure  sometime all full with feasting on your sight  and by and by clean starved for a look  possessing or pursuing no delight  save what is had  or must from you be took  thus do i pine and surfeit day by day  or gluttoning on all  or all away 
 then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now  now  while the world is bent my deeds to cross  join with the spite of fortune  make me bow  and do not drop in for an after loss  ah  do not  when my heart hath scapd this sorrow  come in the rearward of a conquerd woe  give not a windy night a rainy morrow  to linger out a purposd overthrow  if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last  when other petty griefs have done their spite  but in the onset come  so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might  and other strains of woe  which now seem woe  compard with loss of thee  will not seem so 
 o  how thy worth with manners may i sing  when thou art all the better part of me  what can mine own praise to mine own self bring  and what ist but mine own when i praise thee  even for this  let us divided live  and our dear love lose name of single one  that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservst alone  o absence  what a torment wouldst thou prove  were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave  to entertain the time with thoughts of love  which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive  and that thou teachest how to make one twain  by praising him here who doth hence remain 
 if the dull substance of my flesh were thought  injurious distance should not stop my way  for then despite of space i would be brought  from limits far remote  where thou dost stay  no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removd from thee  for nimble thought can jump both sea and land  as soon as think the place where he would be  but  ah  thought kills me that i am not thought  to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone  but that so much of earth and water wrought  i must attend times leisure with my moan  receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears  badges of eithers woe 
 that you were once unkind befriends me now  and for that sorrow  which i then did feel  needs must i under my transgression bow  unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel  for if you were by my unkindness shaken  as i by yours  youve passd a hell of time  and i  a tyrant  have no leisure taken to weigh how once i sufferd in your crime  o  that our night of woe might have rememberd my deepest sense  how hard true sorrow hits  and soon to you  as you to me  then tenderd the humble salve  which wounded bosoms fits  but that your trespass now becomes a fee  mine ransoms yours  and yours must ransom me 
 weary with toil  i haste me to my bed  the dear respose for limbs with travel tird  but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind  when bodys works expired  for then my thoughts  from far where i abide   intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee  and keep my drooping eyelids open wide  looking on darkness which the blind do see  save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view  which  like a jewel  hung in ghastly night  makes black night beauteous  and her old face new  lo  thus  by day my limbs  by night my mind  for thee  and for myself  no quiet find 
 shall i compare thee to a summers day  thou art more lovely and more temperate  rough winds do shake the darling buds of may  and summers lease hath all too short a date  sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines  and often is his gold complexion dimmd  and every fair from fair sometime declines  by chance  or natures changing course untrimmd  but thy eternal summer shall not fade  nor lose possession of that fair thou owst  nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade  when in eternal lines to time thou growst  so long as men can breathe  or eyes can see  so long lives this  and this gives life to thee 
 let not my love be calld idolatry  nor my beloved as an idol show  since all alike my songs and praises be to one  of one  still such  and ever so  kind is my love to day  to morrow kind  still constant in a wondrous excellence  therefore my verse to constancy confind  one thing expressing  leaves out difference  fair  kind  and true  is all my argument  fair  kind  and true  varying to other words  and in this change is my invention spent  three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords  fair  kind  and true  have often livd alone  which three till now  never kept seat in one 
 alas  tis true  i have gone here and there  and made my self a motley to the view  gord mine own thoughts  sold cheap what is most dear  made old offences of affections new  most true it is  that i have lookd on truth askance and strangely  but  by all above  these blenches gave my heart another youth  and worse essays provd thee my best of love  now all is done  save what shall have no end  mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof  to try an older friend  a god in love  to whom i am confind  then give me welcome  next my heaven the best  even to thy pure and most most loving breast 
 my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still  while comments of your praise richly compild  reserve their character with golden quill  and precious phrase by all the muses fild  i think good thoughts  whilst others write good words  and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords  in polishd form of well refined pen  hearing you praised  i say tis so  tis true  and to the most of praise add something more  but that is in my thought  whose love to you  though words come hindmost  holds his rank before  then others  for the breath of words respect  me for my dumb thoughts  speaking in effect 
 so am i as the rich  whose blessed key  can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure  the which he will not every hour survey  for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure  therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare  since  seldom coming in that long year set  like stones of worth they thinly placed are  or captain jewels in the carcanet  so is the time that keeps you as my chest  or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide  to make some special instant special blest  by new unfolding his imprisond pride  blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope  being had  to triumph  being lacked  to hope 
 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold  bare ruind choirs  where late the sweet birds sang  in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west  which by and by black night doth take away  deaths second self  that seals up all in rest  in me thou seest the glowing of such fire  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie  as the death bed  whereon it must expire  consumd with that which it was nourishd by  this thou perceivst  which makes thy love more strong  to love that well  which thou must leave ere long 
 o  lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me  that you should love after my death   dear love  forget me quite  for you in me can nothing worthy prove  unless you would devise some virtuous lie  to do more for me than mine own desert  and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart  o  lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue  my name be buried where my body is  and live no more to shame nor me nor you  for i am shamed by that which i bring forth  and so should you  to love things nothing worth 
 tis better to be vile than vile esteemd  when not to be receives reproach of being  and the just pleasure lost  which is so deemd not by our feeling  but by others seeing  for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood  or on my frailties why are frailer spies  which in their wills count bad what i think good  no  i am that i am  and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own  i may be straight though they themselves be bevel  by their rank thoughts  my deeds must not be shown  unless this general evil they maintain  all men are bad and in their badness reign 
 cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep  a maid of dians this advantage found  and his love kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley fountain of that ground  which borrowd from this holy fire of love  a dateless lively heat  still to endure  and grew a seeting bath  which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure  but at my mistress eye loves brand new fired  the boy for trial needs would touch my breast  i  sick withal  the help of bath desired  and thither hied  a sad distemperd guest  but found no cure  the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire  my mistress eyes 
 o  never say that i was false of heart  though absence seemd my flame to qualify  as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie  that is my home of love  if i have rangd  like him that travels  i return again  just to the time  not with the time exchangd  so that myself bring water for my stain  never believe though in my nature reignd  all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood  that it could so preposterously be staind  to leave for nothing all thy sum of good  for nothing this wide universe i call  save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all 
 alack  what poverty my muse brings forth  that having such a scope to show her pride  the argument  all bare  is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside  o  blame me not  if i no more can write  look in your glass  and there appears a face that over goes my blunt invention quite  dulling my lines  and doing me disgrace  were it not sinful then  striving to mend  to mar the subject that before was well  for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell  and more  much more  than in my verse can sit  your own glass shows you when you look in it 
 since i left you  mine eye is in my mind  and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind  seems seeing  but effectually is out  for it no form delivers to the heart of bird  of flower  or shape which it doth latch  of his quick objects hath the mind no part  nor his own vision holds what it doth catch  for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight  the most sweet favour or deformedst creature  the mountain or the sea  the day or night  the crow  or dove  it shapes them to your feature  incapable of more  replete with you  my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 
 those hours  that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell  will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel  for never resting time leads summer on to hideous winter  and confounds him there  sap checked with frost  and lusty leaves quite gone  beauty oer snowed and bareness every where  then were not summers distillation left  a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass  beautys effect with beauty were bereft  nor it  nor no remembrance what it was  but flowers distilld  though they with winter meet  leese but their show  their substance still lives sweet 
 from fairest creatures we desire increase  that thereby beautys rose might never die  but as the riper should by time decease  his tender heir might bear his memory  but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes  feedst thy lights flame with self substantial fuel  making a famine where abundance lies  thy self thy foe  to thy sweet self too cruel  thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament  and only herald to the gaudy spring  within thine own bud buriest thy content  and tender churl makst waste in niggarding  pity the world  or else this glutton be  to eat the worlds due  by the grave and thee 
 the forward violet thus did i chide  sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells  if not from my loves breath  the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd  the lily i condemned for thy hand  and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair  the roses fearfully on thorns did stand  one blushing shame  another white despair  a third  nor red nor white  had stoln of both  and to his robbery had annexd thy breath  but  for his theft  in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death  more flowers i noted  yet i none could see  but sweet  or colour it had stoln from thee 
 for shame  deny that thou bearst love to any  who for thy self art so unprovident  grant  if thou wilt  thou art belovd of many  but that thou none lovst is most evident  for thou art so possessd with murderous hate  that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire  seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire  o  change thy thought  that i may change my mind  shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love  be  as thy presence is  gracious and kind  or to thyself at least kind hearted prove  make thee another self for love of me  that beauty still may live in thine or thee 
 when most i wink  then do mine eyes best see  for all the day they view things unrespected  but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee  and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed  then thou  whose shadow shadows doth make bright  how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light  when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so  how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day  when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay  all days are nights to see till i see thee  and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 
 some glory in their birth  some in their skill  some in their wealth  some in their bodys force  some in their garments though new fangled ill  some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse  and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure  wherein it finds a joy above the rest  but these particulars are not my measure  all these i better in one general best  thy love is better than high birth to me  richer than wealth  prouder than garments costs  of more delight than hawks and horses be  and having thee  of all mens pride i boast  wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take all this away  and me most wretchcd make 
 some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness  some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport  both grace and faults are lovd of more and less  thou makst faults graces that to thee resort  as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemd  so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated  and for true things deemd  how many lambs might the stern wolf betray  if like a lamb he could his looks translate  how many gazers mightst thou lead away  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as  thou being mine  mine is thy good report 
 they that have power to hurt  and will do none  that do not do the thing they most do show  who  moving others  are themselves as stone  unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow  they rightly do inherit heavens graces  and husband natures riches from expense  they are the lords and owners of their faces  others  but stewards of their excellence  the summers flower is to the summer sweet  though to itself  it only live and die  but if that flower with base infection meet  the basest weed outbraves his dignity  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds  lilies that fester  smell far worse than weeds 
 my glass shall not persuade me i am old  so long as youth and thou are of one date  but when in thee times furrows i behold  then look i death my days should expiate  for all that beauty that doth cover thee  is but the seemly raiment of my heart  which in thy breast doth live  as thine in me  how can i then be elder than thou art  o  therefore love  be of thyself so wary as i  not for myself  but for thee will  bearing thy heart  which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill  presume not on thy heart when mine is slain  thou gavst me thine not to give back again 
 your love and pity doth the impression fill  which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow  for what care i who calls me well or ill  so you oer green my bad  my good allow  you are my all the world  and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue  none else to me  nor i to none alive  that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong  in so profound abysm i throw all care of others voices  that my adders sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are  mark how with my neglect i do dispense  you are so strongly in my purpose bred  that all the world besides methinks are dead 
 like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore  so do our minutes hasten to their end  each changing place with that which goes before  in sequent toil all forwards do contend  nativity  once in the main of light  crawls to maturity  wherewith being crownd  crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight  and time that gave doth now his gift confound  time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beautys brow  feeds on the rarities of natures truth  and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow  and yet to times in hope  my verse shall stand  praising thy worth  despite his cruel hand 
 let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments  love is not love which alters when it alteration finds  or bends with the remover to remove  o  no  it is an ever fixed mark  that looks on tempests and is never shaken  it is the star to every wandering bark  whose worths unknown  although his height be taken  loves not times fool  though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come  love alters not with his brief hours and weeks  but bears it out even to the edge of doom  if this be error and upon me provd  i never writ  nor no man ever lovd
