 taking my pen  with words to cast my woe  duly to count the sum of all my cares  i find my griefs innumerable grow  the recknings rise to millions of despairs  and thus dividing of my fatal hours  the payments of my love i read and cross  subtracting  set my sweets unto my sours  my joys arrearage leads me to my loss  and thus mine eyes a debtor to thine eye  which by extortion gaineth all their looks  my heart hath paid such grievous usury  that all their wealth lies in thy beautys books  and all is thine which hath been due to me  and i a bankrupt  quite undone by thee
