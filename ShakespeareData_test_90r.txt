 tis better to be vile than vile esteemd  when not to be receives reproach of being  and the just pleasure lost  which is so deemd not by our feeling  but by others seeing  for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood  or on my frailties why are frailer spies  which in their wills count bad what i think good  no  i am that i am  and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own  i may be straight though they themselves be bevel  by their rank thoughts  my deeds must not be shown  unless this general evil they maintain  all men are bad and in their badness reign 
 some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness  some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport  both grace and faults are lovd of more and less  thou makst faults graces that to thee resort  as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemd  so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated  and for true things deemd  how many lambs might the stern wolf betray  if like a lamb he could his looks translate  how many gazers mightst thou lead away  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as  thou being mine  mine is thy good report 
 when forty winters shall besiege thy brow  and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field  thy youths proud livery so gazed on now  will be a tatterd weed of small worth held  then being asked  where all thy beauty lies  where all the treasure of thy lusty days  to say  within thine own deep sunken eyes  were an all eating shame  and thriftless praise  how much more praise deservd thy beautys use  if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine shall sum my count  and make my old excuse  proving his beauty by succession thine  this were to be new made when thou art old  and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold 
 o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyd  both truth and beauty on my love depends  so dost thou too  and therein dignified  make answer muse  wilt thou not haply say  truth needs no colour  with his colour fixd  beauty no pencil  beautys truth to lay  but best is best  if never intermixd  because he needs no praise  wilt thou be dumb  excuse not silence so  fort lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praisd of ages yet to be  then do thy office  muse  i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now 
 how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which  like a canker in the fragrant rose  doth spot the beauty of thy budding name  o  in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose  that tongue that tells the story of thy days  making lascivious comments on thy sport  cannot dispraise  but in a kind of praise  naming thy name  blesses an ill report  o  what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee  where beautys veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see  take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege  the hardest knife ill usd doth lose his edge 
 when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights  and beauty making beautiful old rime  in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights  then  in the blazon of sweet beautys best  of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow  i see their antique pen would have expressd even such a beauty as you master now  so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time  all you prefiguring  and for they looked but with divining eyes  they had not skill enough your worth to sing  for we  which now behold these present days  have eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise 
 a womans face with natures own hand painted  hast thou  the master mistress of my passion  a womans gentle heart  but not acquainted with shifting change  as is false womens fashion  an eye more bright than theirs  less false in rolling  gilding the object whereupon it gazeth  a man in hue all hues in his controlling  which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth  and for a woman wert thou first created  till nature  as she wrought thee  fell a doting  and by addition me of thee defeated  by adding one thing to my purpose nothing  but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure  mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure 
 when my love swears that she is made of truth  i do believe her though i know she lies  that she might think me some untutord youth  unlearned in the worlds false subtleties  thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young  although she knows my days are past the best  simply i credit her false speaking tongue  on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed  but wherefore says she not she is unjust  and wherefore say not i that i am old  o  loves best habit is in seeming trust  and age in love  loves not to have years told  therefore i lie with her  and she with me  and in our faults by lies we flatterd be 
 but be contented  when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away  my life hath in this line some interest  which for memorial still with thee shall stay  when thou reviewest this  thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee  the earth can have but earth  which is his due  my spirit is thine  the better part of me  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life  the prey of worms  my body being dead  the coward conquest of a wretchs knife  too base of thee to be remembered  the worth of that is that which it contains  and that is this  and this with thee remains 
 why is my verse so barren of new pride  so far from variation or quick change  why with the time do i not glance aside to new found methods  and to compounds strange  why write i still all one  ever the same  and keep invention in a noted weed  that every word doth almost tell my name  showing their birth  and where they did proceed  o  know sweet love i always write of you  and you and love are still my argument  so all my best is dressing old words new  spending again what is already spent  for as the sun is daily new and old  so is my love still telling what is told 
 those lines that i before have writ do lie  even those that said i could not love you dearer  yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer  but reckoning time  whose milliond accidents creep in twixt vows  and change decrees of kings  tan sacred beauty  blunt the sharpst intents  divert strong minds to the course of altering things  alas  why fearing of times tyranny  might i not then say  now i love you best  when i was certain oer incertainty  crowning the present  doubting of the rest  love is a babe  then might i not say so  to give full growth to that which still doth grow 
 those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend  all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due  uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend  thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd  but those same tongues  that give thee so thine own  in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown  they look into the beauty of thy mind  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds  then  churls  their thoughts  although their eyes were kind  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show  the soil is this  that thou dost common grow 
 the forward violet thus did i chide  sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells  if not from my loves breath  the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd  the lily i condemned for thy hand  and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair  the roses fearfully on thorns did stand  one blushing shame  another white despair  a third  nor red nor white  had stoln of both  and to his robbery had annexd thy breath  but  for his theft  in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death  more flowers i noted  yet i none could see  but sweet  or colour it had stoln from thee 
 as fast as thou shalt wane  so fast thou growst  in one of thine  from that which thou departest  and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst  thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest  herein lives wisdom  beauty  and increase  without this folly  age  and cold decay  if all were minded so  the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away  let those whom nature hath not made for store  harsh  featureless  and rude  barrenly perish  look  whom she best endowd  she gave thee more  which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish  she carvd thee for her seal  and meant thereby  thou shouldst print more  not let that copy die 
 in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn  but thou art twice forsworn  to me love swearing  in act thy bed vow broke  and new faith torn  in vowing new hate after new love bearing  but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee  when i break twenty  i am perjurd most  for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee  and all my honest faith in thee is lost  for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness  oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy  and  to enlighten thee  gave eyes to blindness  or made them swear against the thing they see  for i have sworn thee fair  more perjurd i  to swear against the truth so foul a lie
