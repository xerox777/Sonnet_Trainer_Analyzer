 you that embrace enchanting poesy  be gracious to perplexed corins lines  you that do feel loves proud authority  help me to sing my sighs and sad designs  chloris  requite not faithful love with scorn  but as thou oughtest have commiseration  i have enough anatomised and torn my heart  thereof to make a pure oblation  likewise consider how thy corin prizeth thy parts above each absolute perfection  how he of every precious thing deviseth to make thee sovereign  grant me then affection  else thus i prize thee  chloris is alone more hard than gold or pearl or precious stone

 fidessas worth in time begetteth praise  time  praise  praise  fame  fame  wonderment  wonder  fame  praise  time  her worth do raise to highest pitch of dread astonishment  yet time in time her hardened heart bewrayeth and praise itself her cruelty dispraiseth  so that through praise  alas  her praise decayeth  and that which makes it fall her honour raiseth  most strange  yet true  so wonder  wonder still  and follow fast the wonder of these days  for well i know all wonder to fulfil her will at length unto my will obeys  meantime let others praise her constancy  and me attend upon her clemency
