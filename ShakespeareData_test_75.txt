 thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain full characterd with lasting memory  which shall above that idle rank remain  beyond all date  even to eternity  or  at the least  so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist  till each to razd oblivion yield his part of thee  thy record never can be missd  that poor retention could not so much hold  nor need i tallies thy dear love to score  therefore to give them from me was i bold  to trust those tables that receive thee more  to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me 
 no more be grievd at that which thou hast done  roses have thorns  and silver fountains mud  clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun  and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud  all men make faults  and even i in this  authorizing thy trespass with compare  myself corrupting  salving thy amiss  excusing thy sins more than thy sins are  for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense    thy adverse party is thy advocate    and gainst myself a lawful plea commence  such civil war is in my love and hate  that i an accessary needs must be  to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me 
 in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn  but thou art twice forsworn  to me love swearing  in act thy bed vow broke  and new faith torn  in vowing new hate after new love bearing  but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee  when i break twenty  i am perjurd most  for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee  and all my honest faith in thee is lost  for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness  oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy  and  to enlighten thee  gave eyes to blindness  or made them swear against the thing they see  for i have sworn thee fair  more perjurd i  to swear against the truth so foul a lie 
 unthrifty loveliness  why dost thou spend upon thy self thy beautys legacy  natures bequest gives nothing  but doth lend  and being frank she lends to those are free  then  beauteous niggard  why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give  profitless usurer  why dost thou use so great a sum of sums  yet canst not live  for having traffic with thy self alone  thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive  then how when nature calls thee to be gone  what acceptable audit canst thou leave  thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee  which  used  lives th executor to be 
 farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing  and like enough thou knowst thy estimate  the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing  my bonds in thee are all determinate  for how do i hold thee but by thy granting  and for that riches where is my deserving  the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting  and so my patent back again is swerving  thy self thou gavst  thy own worth then not knowing  or me to whom thou gavst it  else mistaking  so thy great gift  upon misprision growing  comes home again  on better judgement making  thus have i had thee  as a dream doth flatter  in sleep a king  but waking no such matter 
 love is too young to know what conscience is  yet who knows not conscience is born of love  then  gentle cheater  urge not my amiss  lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove  for  thou betraying me  i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason  my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason  but rising at thy name doth point out thee  as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride  he is contented thy poor drudge to be  to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side  no want of conscience hold it that i call her love  for whose dear love i rise and fall 
 when my love swears that she is made of truth  i do believe her though i know she lies  that she might think me some untutord youth  unlearned in the worlds false subtleties  thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young  although she knows my days are past the best  simply i credit her false speaking tongue  on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed  but wherefore says she not she is unjust  and wherefore say not i that i am old  o  loves best habit is in seeming trust  and age in love  loves not to have years told  therefore i lie with her  and she with me  and in our faults by lies we flatterd be 
 o  never say that i was false of heart  though absence seemd my flame to qualify  as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie  that is my home of love  if i have rangd  like him that travels  i return again  just to the time  not with the time exchangd  so that myself bring water for my stain  never believe though in my nature reignd  all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood  that it could so preposterously be staind  to leave for nothing all thy sum of good  for nothing this wide universe i call  save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all 
 like as  to make our appetite more keen  with eager compounds we our palate urge  as  to prevent our maladies unseen  we sicken to shun sickness when we purge  even so  being full of your neer cloying sweetness  to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding  and  sick of welfare  found a kind of meetness to be diseasd  ere that there was true needing  thus policy in love  to anticipate the ills that were not  grew to faults assurd  and brought to medicine a healthful state which  rank of goodness  would by ill be curd  but thence i learn and find the lesson true  drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 
 if the dull substance of my flesh were thought  injurious distance should not stop my way  for then despite of space i would be brought  from limits far remote  where thou dost stay  no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removd from thee  for nimble thought can jump both sea and land  as soon as think the place where he would be  but  ah  thought kills me that i am not thought  to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone  but that so much of earth and water wrought  i must attend times leisure with my moan  receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears  badges of eithers woe 
 thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art  as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel  for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel  yet  in good faith  some say that thee behold  thy face hath not the power to make love groan  to say they err i dare not be so bold  although i swear it to myself alone  and to be sure that is not false i swear  a thousand groans  but thinking on thy face  one on anothers neck  do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgments place  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds  and thence this slander  as i think  proceeds 
 take all my loves  my love  yea take them all  what hast thou then more than thou hadst before  no love  my love  that thou mayst true love call  all mine was thine  before thou hadst this more  then  if for my love  thou my love receivest  i cannot blame thee  for my love thou usest  but yet be blamd  if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest  i do forgive thy robbery  gentle thief  although thou steal thee all my poverty  and yet  love knows it is a greater grief to bear loves wrong  than hates known injury  lascivious grace  in whom all ill well shows  kill me with spites yet we must not be foes 
 poor soul  the centre of my sinful earth  my sinful earth these rebel powers array  why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth  painting thy outward walls so costly gay  why so large cost  having so short a lease  dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend  shall worms  inheritors of this excess  eat up thy charge  is this thy bodys end  then soul  live thou upon thy servants loss  and let that pine to aggravate thy store  buy terms divine in selling hours of dross  within be fed  without be rich no more  so shall thou feed on death  that feeds on men  and death once dead  theres no more dying then 
 let me confess that we two must be twain  although our undivided loves are one  so shall those blots that do with me remain  without thy help  by me be borne alone  in our two loves there is but one respect  though in our lives a separable spite  which though it alter not loves sole effect  yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight  i may not evermore acknowledge thee  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame  nor thou with public kindness honour me  unless thou take that honour from thy name  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as thou being mine  mine is thy good report 
 is it for fear to wet a widows eye  that thou consumst thy self in single life  ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die  the world will wail thee like a makeless wife  the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind  when every private widow well may keep by childrens eyes  her husbands shape in mind  look  what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it  but beautys waste hath in the world an end  and kept unused the user so destroys it  no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murdrous shame commits 
 let not my love be calld idolatry  nor my beloved as an idol show  since all alike my songs and praises be to one  of one  still such  and ever so  kind is my love to day  to morrow kind  still constant in a wondrous excellence  therefore my verse to constancy confind  one thing expressing  leaves out difference  fair  kind  and true  is all my argument  fair  kind  and true  varying to other words  and in this change is my invention spent  three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords  fair  kind  and true  have often livd alone  which three till now  never kept seat in one 
 since brass  nor stone  nor earth  nor boundless sea  but sad mortality oersways their power  how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea  whose action is no stronger than a flower  o  how shall summers honey breath hold out  against the wrackful siege of battering days  when rocks impregnable are not so stout  nor gates of steel so strong but time decays  o fearful meditation  where  alack  shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid  or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back  or who his spoil of beauty can forbid  o  none  unless this miracle have might  that in black ink my love may still shine bright 
 in the old age black was not counted fair  or if it were  it bore not beautys name  but now is black beautys successive heir  and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame  for since each hand hath put on natures power  fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face  sweet beauty hath no name  no holy bower  but is profand  if not lives in disgrace  therefore my mistress eyes are raven black  her eyes so suited  and they mourners seem at such who  not born fair  no beauty lack  slandring creation with a false esteem  yet so they mourn becoming of their woe  that every tongue says beauty should look so 
 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold  bare ruind choirs  where late the sweet birds sang  in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west  which by and by black night doth take away  deaths second self  that seals up all in rest  in me thou seest the glowing of such fire  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie  as the death bed  whereon it must expire  consumd with that which it was nourishd by  this thou perceivst  which makes thy love more strong  to love that well  which thou must leave ere long 
 weret aught to me i bore the canopy  with my extern the outward honouring  or laid great bases for eternity  which proves more short than waste or ruining  have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet  forgoing simple savour  pitiful thrivers  in their gazing spent  no  let me be obsequious in thy heart  and take thou my oblation  poor but free  which is not mixd with seconds  knows no art  but mutual render  only me for thee  hence  thou suborned informer  a true soul when most impeachd  stands least in thy control 
 they that have power to hurt  and will do none  that do not do the thing they most do show  who  moving others  are themselves as stone  unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow  they rightly do inherit heavens graces  and husband natures riches from expense  they are the lords and owners of their faces  others  but stewards of their excellence  the summers flower is to the summer sweet  though to itself  it only live and die  but if that flower with base infection meet  the basest weed outbraves his dignity  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds  lilies that fester  smell far worse than weeds 
 for shame  deny that thou bearst love to any  who for thy self art so unprovident  grant  if thou wilt  thou art belovd of many  but that thou none lovst is most evident  for thou art so possessd with murderous hate  that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire  seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire  o  change thy thought  that i may change my mind  shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love  be  as thy presence is  gracious and kind  or to thyself at least kind hearted prove  make thee another self for love of me  that beauty still may live in thine or thee 
 in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes  for they in thee a thousand errors note  but tis my heart that loves what they despise  who  in despite of view  is pleased to dote  nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted  nor tender feeling  to base touches prone  nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone  but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee  who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man  thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be  only my plague thus far i count my gain  that she that makes me sin awards me pain 
 thy bosom is endeared with all hearts  which i by lacking have supposed dead  and there reigns love  and all loves loving parts  and all those friends which i thought buried  how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye  as interest of the dead  which now appear but things removd that hidden in thee lie  thou art the grave where buried love doth live  hung with the trophies of my lovers gone  who all their parts of me to thee did give  that due of many now is thine alone  their images i lovd  i view in thee  and thou  all they  hast all the all of me 
 ah  wherefore with infection should he live  and with his presence grace impiety  that sin by him advantage should achieve  and lace itself with his society  why should false painting imitate his cheek  and steel dead seeming of his living hue  why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow  since his rose is true  why should he live  now nature bankrupt is  beggard of blood to blush through lively veins  for she hath no exchequer now but his  and proud of many  lives upon his gains  o  him she stores  to show what wealth she had in days long since  before these last so bad 
 thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste  these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear  and of this book  this learning mayst thou taste  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory  thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know times thievish progress to eternity  look  what thy memory cannot contain  commit to these waste blanks  and thou shalt find those children nursed  deliverd from thy brain  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind  these offices  so oft as thou wilt look  shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 
 no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell  nay  if you read this line  remember not the hand that writ it  for i love you so  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot  if thinking on me then should make you woe  o  if   i say you look upon this verse  when i perhaps compounded am with clay  do not so much as my poor name rehearse  but let your love even with my life decay  lest the wise world should look into your moan  and mock you with me after i am gone 
 no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change  thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel  nothing strange  they are but dressings of a former sight  our dates are brief  and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old  and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told  thy registers and thee i both defy  not wondering at the present nor the past  for thy records and what we see doth lie  made more or less by thy continual haste  this i do vow and this shall ever be  i will be true despite thy scythe and thee 
 o  from what power hast thou this powerful might  with insufficiency my heart to sway  to make me give the lie to my true sight  and swear that brightness doth not grace the day  whence hast thou this becoming of things ill  that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill  that  in my mind  thy worst all best exceeds  who taught thee how to make me love thee more  the more i hear and see just cause of hate  o  though i love what others do abhor  with others thou shouldst not abhor my state  if thy unworthiness raisd love in me  more worthy i to be belovd of thee 
 how like a winter hath my absence been from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year  what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen  what old decembers bareness everywhere  and yet this time removed was summers time  the teeming autumn  big with rich increase  bearing the wanton burden of the prime  like widowd wombs after their lords decease  yet this abundant issue seemd to me but hope of orphans  and unfatherd fruit  for summer and his pleasures wait on thee  and  thou away  the very birds are mute  or  if they sing  tis with so dull a cheer  that leaves look pale  dreading the winters near 
 as fast as thou shalt wane  so fast thou growst  in one of thine  from that which thou departest  and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst  thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest  herein lives wisdom  beauty  and increase  without this folly  age  and cold decay  if all were minded so  the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away  let those whom nature hath not made for store  harsh  featureless  and rude  barrenly perish  look  whom she best endowd  she gave thee more  which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish  she carvd thee for her seal  and meant thereby  thou shouldst print more  not let that copy die 
 when most i wink  then do mine eyes best see  for all the day they view things unrespected  but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee  and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed  then thou  whose shadow shadows doth make bright  how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light  when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so  how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day  when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay  all days are nights to see till i see thee  and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 
 thus is his cheek the map of days outworn  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now  before these bastard signs of fair were born  or durst inhabit on a living brow  before the golden tresses of the dead  the right of sepulchres  were shorn away  to live a second life on second head  ere beautys dead fleece made another gay  in him those holy antique hours are seen  without all ornament  itself and true  making no summer of anothers green  robbing no old to dress his beauty new  and him as for a map doth nature store  to show false art what beauty was of yore 
 then let not winters ragged hand deface  in thee thy summer  ere thou be distilld  make sweet some vial  treasure thou some place with beautys treasure ere it be self killd  that use is not forbidden usury  which happies those that pay the willing loan  thats for thy self to breed another thee  or ten times happier  be it ten for one  ten times thy self were happier than thou art  if ten of thine ten times refigurd thee  then what could death do if thou shouldst depart  leaving thee living in posterity  be not self willd  for thou art much too fair to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 
 some glory in their birth  some in their skill  some in their wealth  some in their bodys force  some in their garments though new fangled ill  some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse  and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure  wherein it finds a joy above the rest  but these particulars are not my measure  all these i better in one general best  thy love is better than high birth to me  richer than wealth  prouder than garments costs  of more delight than hawks and horses be  and having thee  of all mens pride i boast  wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take all this away  and me most wretchcd make 
 sweet love  renew thy force  be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite  which but to day by feeding is allayd  to morrow sharpened in his former might  so  love  be thou  although to day thou fill thy hungry eyes  even till they wink with fulness  to morrow see again  and do not kill the spirit of love  with a perpetual dulness  let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore  where two contracted new come daily to the banks  that when they see return of love  more blest may be the view  or call it winter  which being full of care  makes summers welcome  thrice more wished  more rare 
 mine eye and heart are at a mortal war  how to divide the conquest of thy sight  mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar  my heart mine eye the freedom of that right  my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie    a closet never piercd with crystal eyes   but the defendant doth that plea deny  and says in him thy fair appearance lies  to side this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts  all tenants to the heart  and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety  and the dear hearts part  as thus  mine eyes due is thy outward part  and my hearts right  thy inward love of heart
