 whilst thus my pen strives to eternise thee  age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face  where in the map of all my misery is modelled out the world of my disgrace  whilst in despite of tyrannising times  medea like  i make thee young again  proudly thou scornst my world outwearing rhymes  and murtherst virtue with thy coy disdain  and though in youth my youth untimely perish  to keep thee from oblivion and the grave  ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish  where i intombed my better part shall save  and though this earthly body fade and die  my name shall mount upon eternity

 what time fair titan in the zenith sat  and equally the fixed poles did heat  when to my flock my daily woes i chat  and underneath a broad beech took my seat  the dreaming god which morpheus poets call  augmenting fuel to my aetnas fire  with sleep possessing my weak senses all  in apparitions makes my hopes aspire  methought i saw the nymph i would imbrace  with arms abroad coming to me for help  a lust led satyr having her in chase which after her about the fields did yelp  i seeing my love in perplexed plight  a sturdy bat from off an oak i reft  and with the ravisher continue fight till breathless i upon the earth him left  then when my coy nymph saw her breathless foe  with kisses kind she gratifies my pain  protesting never rigour more to show  happy was i this good hap to obtain  but drowsy slumbers flying to their cell  my sudden joy converted was to bale  my wonted sorrows still with me do dwell  i looked round about on hill and dale  but i could neither my fair chloris view  nor yet the satyr which erstwhile i slew

 who doth not know that love is triumphant  sitting upon the throne of majesty  the gods themselves his cruel darts do daunt  and he  blind boy  smiles at their misery  love made great jove ofttimes transform his shape  love made the fierce alcides stoop at last  achilles  stout and bold  could not escape the direful doom which love upon him cast  love made leander pass the dreadful flood which cestos from abydos doth divide  love made a chaos where proud ilion stood  through love the carthaginian dido died  thus may we see how love doth rule and reigns  bringing those under which his power disdains

 you whom the world admires for rarest style  you which have sung the sonnets of true love  upon my maiden verse with favour smile  whose weak penned muse to fly too soon doth prove  before her feathers have their full perfection  she soars aloft  pricked on by blind affection  you whose deep wits  ingine  and industry  the everlasting palm of praise have won  you paragons of learned poesy  favour these mists  which fall before your sun  intentions leading to a more effect if you them grace but with your mild aspect  and thou the genius of my ill tuned note  whose beauty urged hath my rustic vein through mighty oceans of despair to float  that i in rime thy cruelty complain  vouchsafe to read these lines both harsh and bad nuntiates of woe with sorrow being clad

 no choice of change can ever change my mind  choiceless my choice  the choicest choice alive  wonder of women  were she not unkind  the pitiless of pity to deprive  yet she  the kindest creature of her kind  accuseth me of self ingratitude  and well she may  sith by good proof i find myself had died  had she not helpful stood  for when my sickness had the upper hand  and death began to show his awful face  she took great pains my pains for to withstand  and eased my heart that was in heavy case  but cruel now  she scorneth what it craveth  unkind in kindness  murdering while she saveth 
 thy beauty subject of my song i make  o fairest fair  on whom depends my life  refuse not then the task i undertake  to please thy rage and to appease my strife  but with one smile remunerate my toil  none other guerdon i of thee desire  give not my lowly muse new hatched the foil  but warmth that she may at the length aspire unto the temples of thy star bright eyes  upon whose round orbs perfect beauty sits  from whence such glorious crystal beams arise  as best my chloris seemly face befits  which eyes  which beauty  which bright crystal beam  which face of thine hath made my love extreme 
 thou glorious sun  from whence my lesser light the substance of his crystal shine doth borrow  let these my moans find favour in thy sight  and with remorse extinguish now my sorrow  renew those lamps which thy disdain hath quenched  as phoebus doth his sister phoebes shine  consider how thy corin being drenched in seas of woe  to thee his plaints incline  and at thy feet with tears doth sue for grace  which art the goddess of his chaste desire  let not thy frowns these labours poor deface although aloft they at the first aspire  and time shall come as yet unknown to men when i more large thy praises forth shall pen 
 when i the hooks of pleasure first devoured  which undigested threaten now to choke me  fortune on me her golden graces showered  o then delight did to delight provoke me  delight  false instrument of my decay  delight  the nothing that doth all things move  made me first wander from the perfect way  and fast entangled me in the snares of love  then my unhappy happiness at first began  happy in that i loved the fairest fair  unhappily despised  a hapless man  thus joy did triumph  triumph did despair  my conquest is  which shall the conquest gain    fidessa  author both of joy and pain 
 when first i ended  then i first began  then more i travelled further from my rest  where most i lost  there most of all i won  pined with hunger  rising from a feast  methinks i fly  yet want i legs to go  wise in conceit  in act a very sot  ravished with joy amidst a hell of woe  what most i seem that surest am i not  i build my hopes a world above the sky  yet with the mole i creep into the earth  in plenty i am starved with penury  and yet i surfeit in the greatest dearth  i have  i want  despair  and yet desire  burned in a sea of ice  and drowned amidst a fire 
 as other men  so i myself do muse why in this sort i wrest invention so  and why these giddy metaphors i use  leaving the path the greater part do go  i will resolve you  im a lunatic  and ever this in madmen you shall find  what they last thought of when the brain grew sick  in most distraction they keep that in mind  thus talking idly in this bedlam fit  reason and i  you must conceive  are twain  tis nine years now since first i lost my wit  bear with me then though troubled be my brain  with diet and correction men distraught  not too far past  may to their wits be brought 
 give warmth to these young hatched orphan things  which chill with cold to thee for succour creep  they of my study are the budding springs  longer i cannot them in silence keep  they will be gadding sore against my mind  but courteous shepherd  if they run astray  conduct them that they may the pathway find  and teach them how the mean observe they may  thou shalt them ken by their discording notes  their weeds are plain  such as poor shepherds wear  unshapen  torn  and ragged are their coats  yet forth they wandring are devoid of fear  they which have tasted of the muses spring  i hope will smile upon the tunes they sing 
 calling to mind since first my love begun  thuncertain times  oft varying in their course  how things still unexpectedly have run  ast please the fates by their resistless force  lastly  mine eyes amazedly have seen essexs great fall  tyrone his peace to gain  the quiet end of that long living queen  this kings fair entrance  and our peace with spain  we and the dutch at length ourselves to sever  thus the world doth and evermore shall reel  yet to my goddess am i constant ever  howeer blind fortune turn her giddy wheel  though heaven and earth prove both to me untrue  yet am i still inviolate to you 
 my cruel fortunes clouded with a frown  lurk in the bosom of eternal night  my climbing thoughts are basely hauled down  my best devices prove but after sight  poor outcast of the worlds exiled room  i live in wilderness of deep lament  no hope reserved me but a hopeless tomb  when fruitless life and fruitful woes are spent  shall phoebus hinder little stars to shine  or lofty cedar mushrooms leave to grow  sure mighty men at little ones repine  the rich is to the poor a common foe  fidessa  seeing how the world doth go  joineth with fortune in my overthrow 
 youre not alone when you are still alone  o god  from you that i could private be  since you one were  i never since was one  since you in me  myself since out of me  transported from myself into your being  though either distant  present yet to either  senseless with too much joy  each other seeing  and only absent when we are together  give me my self  and take your self again  devise some means but how i may forsake you  so much is mine that doth with you remain  that taking what is mine  with me i take you  you do bewitch me  o that i could fly from my self you  or from your own self i 
 truce  gentle love  a parley now i crave  methinks tis long since first these wars begun  nor thou  nor i  the better yet can have  bad is the match where neither party won  i offer free conditions of fair peace  my heart for hostage that it shall remain  discharge our forces  here let malice cease  so for my pledge thou give me pledge again  or if no thing but death will serve thy turn  still thirsting for subversion of my state  do what thou canst  raze  massacre  and burn  let the world see the utmost of thy hate  i send defiance  since if overthrown  thou vanquishing  the conquest is mine own 
 an evil spirit  your beauty  haunts me still  wherewith  alas  i have been long possessed  which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill  nor give me once but one poor minutes rest  in me it speaks whether i sleep or wake  and when by means to drive it out i try  with greater torments then it me doth take  and tortures me in most extremity  before my face it lays down my despairs  and hastes me on unto a sudden death  now tempting me to drown myself in tears  and then in sighing to give up my breath  thus am i still provoked to every evil  by this good wicked spirit  sweet angel devil 
 taking my pen  with words to cast my woe  duly to count the sum of all my cares  i find my griefs innumerable grow  the recknings rise to millions of despairs  and thus dividing of my fatal hours  the payments of my love i read and cross  subtracting  set my sweets unto my sours  my joys arrearage leads me to my loss  and thus mine eyes a debtor to thine eye  which by extortion gaineth all their looks  my heart hath paid such grievous usury  that all their wealth lies in thy beautys books  and all is thine which hath been due to me  and i a bankrupt  quite undone by thee 
 weep now no more  mine eyes  but be you drowned in your own tears  so many years distilled  and let her know that at them long hath frowned  that you can weep no more although she willed  this hap her cruelty hath her allotten  who whilom was commandress of each part  that now her proper griefs must be forgotten by those true outward signs of inward smart  for how can he that hath not one tear left him  stream out those floods that are due unto her moaning  when both of eyes and tears she hath bereft him  o yet ill signify my grief with groaning  true sighs  true groans shall echo in the air and say  fidessa  though most cruel  is most fair 
 i see  i hear  i feel  i know  i rue my fate  my fame  my pain  my loss  my fall  mishap  reproach  disdain  a crown  her hue  cruel  still flying  false  fair  funeral  to cross  to shame  bewitch  deceive  and kill my first proceedings in their flowing bloom  my worthless pen fast chained to my will  my erring life through an uncertain doom  my thoughts that yet in lowliness do mount  my heart the subject of her tyranny  what now remains but her severe account of murders crying guilt  foul butchery  she was unhappy in her cradle breath  that given was to be anothers death 
 in former times  such as had store of coin  in wars at home or when for conquests bound  for fear that some their treasure should purloin  gave it to keep to spirits within the ground  and to attend it them as strongly tied till they returned  home when they never came  such as by art to get the same have tried  from the strong spirit by no means force the same  nearer men come  that further flies away  striving to hold it strongly in the deep  evn as this spirit  so you alone do play with those rich beauties heavn gives you to keep  pity so left to th coldness of your blood  not to avail you nor do others good 
 my fixed faith against oblivion fights  and i cannot forget her  pretty elf  although she cruel be unto my plights  yet let me rather clean forget myself  then her sweet name out of my mind should go  which is th elixir of my pining soul  from whence the essence of my life doth flow  whose beauty rare my senses all control  themselves most happy evermore accounting  that such a nymph is queen of their affection  with ravished rage they to the skies are mounting  esteeming not their thraldom nor subjection  but still do joy amidst their misery  with patience bearing loves captivity
