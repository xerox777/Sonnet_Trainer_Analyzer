 thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain full characterd with lasting memory  which shall above that idle rank remain  beyond all date  even to eternity  or  at the least  so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist  till each to razd oblivion yield his part of thee  thy record never can be missd  that poor retention could not so much hold  nor need i tallies thy dear love to score  therefore to give them from me was i bold  to trust those tables that receive thee more  to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me

 thine eyes i love  and they  as pitying me  knowing thy heart torment me with disdain  have put on black and loving mourners be  looking with pretty ruth upon my pain  and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east  nor that full star that ushers in the even  doth half that glory to the sober west  as those two mourning eyes become thy face  o  let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace  and suit thy pity like in every part  then will i swear beauty herself is black  and all they foul that thy complexion lack 
 so shall i live  supposing thou art true  like a deceived husband  so loves face may still seem love to me  though alterd new  thy looks with me  thy heart in other place  for there can live no hatred in thine eye  therefore in that i cannot know thy change  in manys looks  the false hearts history is writ in moods  and frowns  and wrinkles strange  but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell  whateer thy thoughts  or thy hearts workings be  thy looks should nothing thence  but sweetness tell  how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

 not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come  can yet the lease of my true love control  supposed as forfeit to a confind doom  the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd  and the sad augurs mock their own presage  incertainties now crown themselves assurd  and peace proclaims olives of endless age  now with the drops of this most balmy time  my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes  since  spite of him  ill live in this poor rime  while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes  and thou in this shalt find thy monument  when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 
 my love is strengthend  though more weak in seeming  i love not less  though less the show appear  that love is merchandizd  whose rich esteeming  the owners tongue doth publish every where  our love was new  and then but in the spring  when i was wont to greet it with my lays  as philomel in summers front doth sing  and stops her pipe in growth of riper days  not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night  but that wild music burthens every bough  and sweets grown common lose their dear delight  therefore like her  i sometime hold my tongue  because i would not dull you with my song 
 why is my verse so barren of new pride  so far from variation or quick change  why with the time do i not glance aside to new found methods  and to compounds strange  why write i still all one  ever the same  and keep invention in a noted weed  that every word doth almost tell my name  showing their birth  and where they did proceed  o  know sweet love i always write of you  and you and love are still my argument  so all my best is dressing old words new  spending again what is already spent  for as the sun is daily new and old  so is my love still telling what is told 
 in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes  for they in thee a thousand errors note  but tis my heart that loves what they despise  who  in despite of view  is pleased to dote  nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted  nor tender feeling  to base touches prone  nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone  but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee  who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man  thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be  only my plague thus far i count my gain  that she that makes me sin awards me pain 
 i grant thou wert not married to my muse  and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject  blessing every book  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue  finding thy worth a limit past my praise  and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time bettering days  and do so  love  yet when they have devisd  what strained touches rhetoric can lend  thou truly fair  wert truly sympathizd in true plain words  by thy true telling friend  and their gross painting might be better usd where cheeks need blood  in thee it is abusd 
 as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth  so i  made lame by fortunes dearest spite  take all my comfort of thy worth and truth  for whether beauty  birth  or wealth  or wit  or any of these all  or all  or more  entitled in thy parts  do crowned sit  i make my love engrafted  to this store  so then i am not lame  poor  nor despisd  whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficd  and by a part of all thy glory live  look what is best  that best i wish in thee  this wish i have  then ten times happy me 
 if my dear love were but the child of state  it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd  as subject to times love or to times hate  weeds among weeds  or flowers with flowers gatherd  no  it was builded far from accident  it suffers not in smiling pomp  nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent  whereto th inviting time our fashion calls  it fears not policy  that heretic  which works on leases of short numberd hours  but all alone stands hugely politic  that it nor grows with heat  nor drowns with showers  to this i witness call the fools of time  which die for goodness  who have lived for crime 
 those lips that loves own hand did make  breathed forth the sound that said i hate  to me that languishd for her sake  but when she saw my woeful state  straight in her heart did mercy come  chiding that tongue that ever sweet was usd in giving gentle doom  and taught it thus anew to greet  i hate she alterd with an end  that followed it as gentle day  doth follow night  who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away  i hate  from hate away she threw  and savd my life  saying not you 
 no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change  thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel  nothing strange  they are but dressings of a former sight  our dates are brief  and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old  and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told  thy registers and thee i both defy  not wondering at the present nor the past  for thy records and what we see doth lie  made more or less by thy continual haste  this i do vow and this shall ever be  i will be true despite thy scythe and thee 
 when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state  and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries  and look upon myself  and curse my fate  wishing me like to one more rich in hope  featurd like him  like him with friends possessd  desiring this mans art  and that mans scope  with what i most enjoy contented least  yet in these thoughts my self almost despising  haply i think on thee    and then my state  like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth  sings hymns at heavens gate  for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings 
 how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which  like a canker in the fragrant rose  doth spot the beauty of thy budding name  o  in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose  that tongue that tells the story of thy days  making lascivious comments on thy sport  cannot dispraise  but in a kind of praise  naming thy name  blesses an ill report  o  what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee  where beautys veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see  take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege  the hardest knife ill usd doth lose his edge 
 when thou shalt be disposd to set me light  and place my merit in the eye of scorn  upon thy side  against myself ill fight  and prove thee virtuous  though thou art forsworn  with mine own weakness  being best acquainted  upon thy part i can set down a story of faults conceald  wherein i am attainted  that thou in losing me shalt win much glory  and i by this will be a gainer too  for bending all my loving thoughts on thee  the injuries that to myself i do  doing thee vantage  double vantage me  such is my love  to thee i so belong  that for thy right  myself will bear all wrong
